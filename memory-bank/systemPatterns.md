# System Patterns *Optional*

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.
It is optional, but recommended to be updated as the project evolves.

## Coding Patterns

* **Hybrid Rules Approach**: The system implements a hybrid approach for rule representation:
  - Uses dictionary/object representation for rules (JSON-serializable)
  - Implements adapter pattern to transform between dictionary representation and object-oriented rule models
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing dictionary-based rule systems
  - Provides enhanced capabilities through object methods while preserving serialization/deserialization
  - Rule structure includes metadata, conditions, actions, and evaluation metrics
  - Supports version control and lineage tracking for rule evolution

## Architectural Patterns

* **GPT-Symbolic Feedback Loop**: Core architectural pattern for Recursive AI Training:
  - Creates a closed feedback loop between symbolic rule system and GPT models
  - Steps: Data observation → Feature extraction → ML prediction → Rule generation → Symbolic evaluation → GPT-assisted rule refinement → Rule repository update
  - Maintains separation between rule generation, evaluation, and refinement stages
  - Implements circuit breakers to prevent infinite feedback loops
  - Uses weighted scoring to prioritize rule improvements
  - Integrates with the existing Trust Engine for credibility assessment

* **Advanced Metrics with Uncertainty Quantification**:
  - Implements confidence intervals for all performance metrics
  - Uses bootstrap resampling for robust uncertainty estimation
  - Combines multiple metric types (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) with uncertainty bands
  - Implements decay functions for temporal relevance of historical performance
  - Provides explicit uncertainty visualization in dashboards
  - Uses uncertainty thresholds for automatic triggering of retraining cycles

## Testing Patterns

* **Curriculum Testing for Recursive Training**:
  - Implements progressively more challenging test cases
  - Creates synthetic edge cases for rule evaluation
  - Uses property-based testing for rule validation
  - Maintains separate test sets for different stages of the recursive training pipeline
  - Implements automatic test generation based on historical failure patterns
  - Isolates test environments to prevent cross-contamination between test runs
