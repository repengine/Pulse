## Rationale

* [2025-04-30 12:32:55] - **Rationale:** The forecasting pipeline was experiencing errors when string values were encountered in places where numeric operations were being performed. This was happening because some forecasts or adjustments were being stored as strings rather than numbers, likely during serialization/deserialization processes or data extraction from external sources. Explicit type conversion with error handling was needed to ensure robust operation.
* [2025-04-30 20:45:30] - **Rationale:** A hybrid rules approach provides a smooth transition path that preserves compatibility with existing systems while enabling gradual enhancement of rule capabilities. This approach minimizes disruption to current operations while allowing us to incrementally introduce more sophisticated rule structures, improved type safety, and object-oriented features. The transition will happen in parallel with the phased implementation of recursive AI training capabilities.
* [2025-04-30 20:47:55] - **Rationale:** The implementation of recursive AI training represents a significant enhancement to the system capabilities, warranting a minor version update from v0.2.1 to v0.3.0. The "Recursive Learning" subtitle highlights the central new feature of this release.
* [2025-04-30 21:41:15] - **Rationale:** Implementing a GPT-Symbolic feedback loop in the RecursiveRuleGenerator allows for continuous improvement of rule quality by leveraging both LLM capabilities and symbolic verification. This approach facilitates more effective rule generation through the combination of GPT's creative generation abilities with symbolic system feedback for validation and refinement.
* [2025-04-30 21:41:30] - **Rationale:** A dedicated RecursiveRuleEvaluator component allows for systematic assessment of rule effectiveness outside of the generation process. This separation of concerns enables more thorough testing of rules against multiple datasets and conditions, providing clear metrics for rule quality and identifying areas for improvement.
* [2025-04-30 21:41:45] - **Rationale:** A versioned RuleRepository with querying capabilities enables efficient rule management throughout their lifecycle. This approach supports historical analysis, A/B testing of rule sets, and graceful evolution of rules over time while maintaining system stability.
* [2025-05-01 00:11:00] - **Rationale:** Implementing an uncertainty-driven curriculum for retrodiction allows the system to focus training resources on the most challenging or uncertain predictions. This approach optimizes learning efficiency by prioritizing areas where the system has the lowest confidence, leading to faster improvement in overall prediction accuracy and robustness.
* [2025-05-01 00:11:15] - **Rationale:** A comprehensive error handling system is essential for maintaining system stability during recursive training cycles. By implementing robust error detection, logging, and recovery mechanisms, the system can gracefully handle failures without interrupting the training process, ensuring data integrity and continuous operation even when unexpected conditions arise.
* [2025-05-01 00:11:30] - **Rationale:** Visualization tools for metrics provide critical insights into system performance and behavior during recursive training. These tools enable rapid identification of trends, anomalies, and optimization opportunities that might not be apparent from raw data alone, facilitating more effective monitoring, debugging, and improvement of the recursive training process.

## Implementation Details

* [2025-04-30 04:10:05] - Phase 2 Orchestrator Refactoring: TrustEngine refactored for SRP and Strategy Pattern (enrichment and scoring logic extracted to services, symbolic tag logic prepared for service extraction). Simulator Core refactored to use Command Pattern and SimulationRunner abstraction. All usages updated to new interfaces.
* [2025-04-30 12:32:55] - **Implementation Details:** Modified forecast_ensemble.py to add explicit float() conversions with proper try/except blocks to handle conversion errors gracefully. Added appropriate warning logs to identify invalid values at runtime. Used safe default values (0.0) when conversion fails to allow the system to continue functioning despite bad input data.
* [2025-04-30 20:45:30] - **Implementation Details:** The implementation plan includes: (1) Creating adapter interfaces that work with both dictionary and object-based rules; (2) Implementing cost control systems with token/request limits to prevent unexpected expenses; (3) Building the recursive AI training pipeline in phases (Data Pipeline and Core Metrics in Phase 1, Rule Generation in Phase 2, and Advanced Metrics + Error Handling in Phase 3); (4) Incorporating GPT-Symbolic feedback loops and uncertainty-driven curriculum for more efficient training; (5) Developing a rule review dashboard for monitoring and managing rule quality and performance.
* [2025-04-30 20:47:55] - **Implementation Details:** Updated the README.md to reflect version 0.3.0 "Recursive Learning", added a new patch notes section for v0.3.x detailing the key features of the recursive AI training implementation, and preserved all existing content from the previous version of the README.

The evaluator includes capabilities for batch evaluation of multiple rules, comparative analysis against baseline rule sets, and detailed reporting of evaluation results. Integration with the symbolic system ensures consistent verification methods between generation and evaluation phases.
