## Decision

* [2025-04-30 12:32:55] - **Decision:** Implement robust type checking and conversion in the forecast ensemble module to prevent "must be real number, not str" errors.

## Rationale

* [2025-04-30 12:32:55] - **Rationale:** The forecasting pipeline was experiencing errors when string values were encountered in places where numeric operations were being performed. This was happening because some forecasts or adjustments were being stored as strings rather than numbers, likely during serialization/deserialization processes or data extraction from external sources. Explicit type conversion with error handling was needed to ensure robust operation.

## Implementation Details

[2025-04-30 04:10:05] - Phase 2 Orchestrator Refactoring: TrustEngine refactored for SRP and Strategy Pattern (enrichment and scoring logic extracted to services, symbolic tag logic prepared for service extraction). Simulator Core refactored to use Command Pattern and SimulationRunner abstraction. All usages updated to new interfaces.
* [2025-04-30 12:32:55] - **Implementation Details:** Modified forecast_ensemble.py to add explicit float() conversions with proper try/except blocks to handle conversion errors gracefully. Added appropriate warning logs to identify invalid values at runtime. Used safe default values (0.0) when conversion fails to allow the system to continue functioning despite bad input data.
