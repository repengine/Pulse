## Completed Tasks

*
* [2025-04-30 10:54:04] - Completed architectural refactoring plan: System Decoupling, Orchestrator Refactoring, Retrodiction Feature Completion, and Test Resolution. Addressed tight coupling, simplified orchestrators, completed retrodiction, and resolved all previously failing tests (140 passing, 5 skipped, 0 failures). The project is now significantly more maintainable, testable, and robust.
* [2025-04-30 12:32:40] - Fixed "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in the forecasting pipeline. Implemented robust type checking and conversion in forecast_ensemble.py. Added explicit float() conversion with try/except blocks to handle type conversion errors gracefully.
* [2025-04-30 17:02:45] - Implemented targeted fix for "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in forecast_output/forecast_generator.py. Added filtering to ensure only numeric values are passed to the AI model, preventing type errors when the model tries to process string values.

## Next Steps

*
* [2025-04-30 11:03:30] - Investigate and resolve additional skipped tests, starting with the remaining Graphviz dependency issue. Improve error handling and documentation for optional dependencies.
