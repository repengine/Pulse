## Active Tasks

:start_line:11
-------
* [2025-05-02 10:43:00] - Implemented core components of the Conversational Interface (WIP). This includes:
    *   Vector store implementation (`chatmode/vector_store/codebase_vector_store.py`) using Sentence-Transformers and Faiss.
    *   Codebase parser (`chatmode/vector_store/codebase_parser.py`) for extracting document chunks from .py and .md files.
    *   Script to build and save the vector store (`chatmode/vector_store/build_vector_store.py`).
    *   Placeholder structure for LLM integration (`chatmode/llm_integration/llm_model.py`, `chatmode/llm_integration/domain_adapter.py`).
    *   Core conversational logic (`chatmode/conversational_core.py`) with basic intent recognition, RAG, prompt assembly, and placeholder tool calls.
    *   Basic Tkinter UI (`chatmode/ui/conversational_gui.py`).
    *   Placeholder Pulse module adapters (`chatmode/integrations/pulse_module_adapters.py`).

## Completed Tasks

* [2025-05-02 11:51:00] - Added new stock symbols (JPM, V, PG, DIS, NFLX) to the `VARIABLE_REGISTRY` in `core/variable_registry.py`.

[2025-04-30 04:16:19] - Completed implementation of the Recursive AI Training system including all three phases: Data Pipeline & Core Metrics, Rule Generation, and Advanced Metrics & Error Handling.
[2025-05-01 19:09:28] - Updated NASDAQ Data Link (Quandl) plugin to use current API endpoints, replacing deprecated WIKI datasets. Added robust error handling and mock data fallback for API access limitations.
[2025-05-01 19:12:00] - Configured API keys for FRED, Finnhub, and NASDAQ with dual naming convention support (both API_KEY and KEY formats). Updated the environment variables checker to properly verify all keys. Test results show FRED and Finnhub APIs are fully operational, while NASDAQ API requires specific dataset selection based on subscription level.
[2025-05-01 20:35:00] - Implemented data persistence functionality across multiple API plugins to write data to files during ingestion, not just after. Updated the NASDAQ plugin, Google Trends plugin, and OpenAQ plugin to use the iris_utils.ingestion_persistence module for comprehensive data capture at all stages of the API ingestion process. This enhances debugging capabilities, provides historical data records, and improves system reliability.
[2025-05-02 09:55:00] - Completed the Historical Timeline Project. This involved planning, identifying variable sources, implementing historical data retrieval with persistence, standardizing data storage using RecursiveDataStore, developing comprehensive data verification and quality assurance methods, and creating a system for handling missing data and inconsistencies. A robust pipeline for collecting, standardizing, verifying, and repairing historical time series data has been established.
[2025-05-02 12:20:00] - Enhanced API plugins to write data to file incrementally during ingestion rather than only after completion. Added a new `save_data_point_incremental` function to the ingestion_persistence module and updated AlphaVantage and NASDAQ plugins to use this approach for all data types. Created a test script to verify proper functionality. This ensures data is preserved even if the ingestion process is interrupted and makes real-time data immediately available to other processes.
