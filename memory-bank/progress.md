## Completed Tasks

*
* [2025-04-30 10:54:04] - Completed architectural refactoring plan: System Decoupling, Orchestrator Refactoring, Retrodiction Feature Completion, and Test Resolution. Addressed tight coupling, simplified orchestrators, completed retrodiction, and resolved all previously failing tests (140 passing, 5 skipped, 0 failures). The project is now significantly more maintainable, testable, and robust.
* [2025-04-30 12:32:40] - Fixed "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in the forecasting pipeline. Implemented robust type checking and conversion in forecast_ensemble.py. Added explicit float() conversion with try/except blocks to handle type conversion errors gracefully.
* [2025-04-30 17:02:45] - Implemented targeted fix for "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in forecast_output/forecast_generator.py. Added filtering to ensure only numeric values are passed to the AI model, preventing type errors when the model tries to process string values.
* [2025-04-30 21:39:30] - Completed Phase 1 of Recursive AI Training: Data Pipeline & Core Metrics. Implemented RecursiveDataIngestionManager, RecursiveDataStore, RecursiveFeatureProcessor, MetricsStore, RecursiveTrainingMetrics, and integration components. Created comprehensive tests for all components.
* [2025-04-30 21:39:45] - Completed Phase 2 of Recursive AI Training: Rule Generation. Implemented RecursiveRuleGenerator with GPT-Symbolic feedback loop, RecursiveRuleEvaluator for rule effectiveness testing, RuleRepository with versioning and querying, and created hybrid dictionary/object rule representation adapter.
* [2025-05-01 00:10:00] - Completed Phase 3 of Recursive AI Training: Advanced Metrics & Error Handling. Implemented enhanced metrics with uncertainty quantification, comprehensive error handling system with recovery mechanisms, and visualization tools for monitoring system performance and metrics.

## Current Tasks

*
* [2025-04-30 20:47:32] - Updated README.md to version 0.3.0 "Recursive Learning" to reflect the new recursive AI training implementation. Added new patch notes section detailing the key features of the implementation.

## Next Steps

*
* [2025-04-30 11:03:30] - Investigate and resolve additional skipped tests, starting with the remaining Graphviz dependency issue. Improve error handling and documentation for optional dependencies.
[2025-05-01 01:44:41] - Completed analysis of ground truth dataset generator improvements for Pulse AI training system.

Summary of recommendations:
- Enforce schema and range validation for all ingested data; cross-check overlapping series from multiple APIs.
- Apply anomaly detection (Hampel/rolling z-score, STL, Grubbsâ€™/ESD, CUSUM) and structured imputation (gap-limited forward/backward fill, seasonal interpolation, ARIMA).
- Use stratified/event-based sampling, multi-frequency aggregation, and structured windowing for efficient model training.
- Engineer features: multi-horizon lags, rolling stats, differences, cyclical encodings, spreads, and dimensionality reduction.
- Add new data sources (PMI, alternative/unstructured, global macro, high-frequency), automate QA reporting (Great Expectations, Airflow, dashboards), and implement robust backtesting/drift monitoring for prediction validation.

These steps will enhance Pulse's forecasting accuracy and reliability by improving the quality, structure, and validation of ground truth data.

* [2025-05-01 01:52:51] - Developed comprehensive AI training program design leveraging the ground truth dataset generator with a $150 budget constraint.

The three-phase approach includes:

Phase 1: Foundation Data Collection ($60)
- Prioritized API usage: World Bank (free), FRED (~$20), Alpha Vantage (~$40)
- Schema implementation with range validation and cross-source consistency checks
- Data quality foundations with missing-value handling and anomaly detection

Phase 2: Advanced Processing & Optimization ($50)
- Feature engineering pipeline with lags, statistical moments, growth rates, spreads
- Training optimization with stratified sampling and structured windowing
- Validation framework with backtesting pipelines and performance metrics

Phase 3: Refinement & Integration ($40)
- Strategic API calls to FINNHUB and NASDAQ for targeted data
- Synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented market conditions
- Production integration with automated updates and drift detection

This phased implementation ensures a solid foundation before advancing to more sophisticated techniques while strategically allocating the budget to maximize impact on model performance.
