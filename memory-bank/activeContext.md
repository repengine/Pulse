## Recent Changes

*
- [2025-05-02 16:47:14] - Implemented OpenAI GPT integration for the Pulse conversational interface, including support for GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo models, configuration system, GUI model selection, error handling, and cost estimation.
- [2025-05-02 16:59:45] - Completed data loading optimization task by creating `OptimizedDataStore` with vectorized filtering, memory-mapping, LRU caching, and parallel loading, and integrating it into `recursive_training/parallel_trainer.py`.
- [2025-05-02 17:09:41] - Completed trust tracker updates and metrics/logging optimization: Implemented `TrustUpdateBuffer` for batching trust updates and `AsyncMetricsCollector` for non-blocking metrics/logging, integrated into `parallel_trainer.py`.
- [2025-04-30 12:32:30] - Fixed "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" by implementing robust type checking and conversion in forecast_ensemble.py. Added explicit float() conversion with try/except blocks to handle type conversion errors gracefully with appropriate warning logs.
- [2025-04-30 17:03:00] - Implemented targeted fix for "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in forecast_output/forecast_generator.py by filtering input_features to only include numeric values before passing to the AI model. This addresses the underlying issue at the source by removing string values that the model cannot process.
- [2025-05-02 10:43:00] - Initiated and implemented core components for the Conversational Interface (WIP). This project focuses on a hybrid RAG + lightweight domain-adapter approach for efficient natural language interaction with the Pulse codebase and functionalities. Key implemented parts include the vector store (Sentence-Transformers, Faiss), codebase parsing, vector store building script, placeholder structures for LLM/LoRA integration, the core conversational logic with basic intent recognition and RAG, a basic Tkinter UI, and placeholder Pulse module adapters.
| - [2025-05-02 12:20:00] - Enhanced API plugins to write data to file incrementally during ingestion using a new `save_data_point_incremental` function in the `ingestion_persistence` module. This ensures data is preserved even if the ingestion process is interrupted and makes real-time data immediately available to other processes. Modified the AlphaVantage and NASDAQ plugins to use this approach and added a test script to verify the implementation.
| - [2025-05-02 13:43:00] - Integrated manual bulk World Bank historical data into the Pulse pipeline by creating a dedicated module (`iris/iris_utils/world_bank_integration.py`) that handles extracting, processing, transforming, and storing 12 key global economic indicators in the RecursiveDataStore. Enhanced the CLI tool with a "world-bank" command for seamless integration and improved the historical data pipeline's coverage with global economic metrics (GDP, inflation, unemployment, etc.). This extends the Historical Timeline Project with additional international economic variables for forecasting.

- [2025-05-02 14:36:04] - Completed GUI enhancement phase for the conversational interface.
- [2025-05-02 14:48:24] - Completed Conversational Core refinement phase for the conversational interface.
- [2025-05-02 15:34:00] - Completed implementation of the Pulse Module Adapters for the conversational interface (`chatmode/integrations/pulse_module_adapters.py`).
- [2025-05-02 15:41:49] - Completed implementation of recursive learning control interactions for the conversational interface.
- [2025-05-02 15:52:00] - Optimized the retrodiction training pipeline with vectorized operations, parallel processing, and efficient data structures. Key improvements include: optimized Bayesian trust tracking with batch operations, vectorized causal operations for faster discovery, parallel training framework for distributed processing, and enhanced counterfactual engine with caching and parallelization.
- [2025-05-02 18:03:30] - Completed benchmarking of optimization improvements to the retrodiction training pipeline. Results confirm a 3.0x parallel speedup with Dask local cluster integration, significant improvements in trust updates with the new batching buffer, and extremely efficient causal discovery with vectorized operations. Data loading remains the largest bottleneck at over 50% of execution time, even with the optimized data store improvements, indicating this should be a focus area for future optimizations.
- [2025-05-02 17:19:47] - Completed Dask local cluster integration prototype for the ParallelTrainingCoordinator, enabling enhanced parallel processing.
- [2025-05-02 19:43:00] - Completed streaming data loading optimizations, including the implementation of `StreamingDataStore` with enhanced columnar data format usage, intelligent prefetching, and memory-efficient loading, and integration with `ParallelTrainingCoordinator`.
- [2025-05-02 20:45:00] - Completed implementation of AWS Batch integration for retrodiction training, including infrastructure setup, job submission, and orchestration.
## Open Questions/Issues
- [2025-05-02 21:29:33] - Implemented data ingestion logic for key economic indicators (Interest rates, Inflation, Industrial Production, Unemployment, Retail Sales, Money Supply, Exchange Rates, Credit Spreads, Housing Starts) from publicly available sources (FRED, BLS, U.S. Census Bureau) and created placeholder plugins for sources likely requiring subscriptions (ISM, University of Michigan, CBOE). Created new plugin files in `iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/` and integrated incremental data persistence.

*
[2025-05-02 11:47:00] - Acquired premium Alpha Vantage API key with 150 requests/minute limit and access to both 15-minute delayed and real-time US stock market data. This provides an opportunity to enhance Pulse's data ingestion and predictive capabilities through more current market data.

[2025-04-30 03:48:31] - Architectural Analysis Summary:
*   **Strengths:** Good high-level modularity (Simulation, Rules, Symbolic, Trust, Memory, Core); extensive feature implementation; sophisticated subsystems; centralized configuration.
*   **Key Concern:** Significant *tight coupling* between core systems (Simulation, Trust, Symbolic, Core) hinders maintainability, testability, and robust evolution, despite the need for interaction for learning. Interactions rely on internal details rather than stable interfaces.
*   **Other Concerns:** Complexity in core orchestrators (`simulator_core`, `TrustEngine`); incomplete features (e.g., full rule-based retrodiction); 24 failing tests indicate stability issues.
*   **Recommendation:** Prioritize refactoring towards **looser coupling** (clearer interfaces, reduced internal dependencies) to support robust learning and evolution. Simplify complex orchestrators and resolve all failing tests.

[2025-05-01 20:35:00] - Extended data persistence capabilities across API plugins to store data during ingestion. Implemented persistence in NASDAQ, Google Trends, and OpenAQ plugins following the pattern established in the Alpha Vantage plugin. Each plugin now saves request metadata, raw API responses, and processed data to standardized directory structures with timestamps.

Implemented phases for Variable and Source Identification, Historical Data Retrieval (including persistence), Data Storage and Standardization (using RecursiveDataStore), Data Verification and Quality Assurance, and Handling Missing Data and Inconsistencies. Developed new modules (`historical_data_retriever.py`, `historical_data_transformer.py`, `historical_data_verification.py`, `historical_data_repair.py`) and enhanced the CLI (`cli_historical_data.py`) to manage the historical data pipeline.
| - [2025-05-02 14:32:07] - Enhanced the World Bank data integration module with a robust fallback storage mechanism, implemented a PathSanitizingDataStore wrapper class to handle path-related issues, and added country-specific data organization in the fallback storage to improve data accessibility.
