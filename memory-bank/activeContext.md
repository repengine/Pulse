## Current Focus

*
- All phases of the Recursive AI Training system have been successfully completed (Phase 1: Data Pipeline & Core Metrics, Phase 2: Rule Generation, and Phase 3: Advanced Metrics & Error Handling).
- Phase 3 has been completed with the implementation of enhanced metrics with uncertainty quantification, comprehensive error handling system with recovery mechanisms, and visualization tools for metrics.
- The Recursive AI Training system is now fully operational and ready for recursive training cycles.
- The hybrid rules approach has been implemented, maintaining compatibility with existing dictionary-based rules while introducing object capabilities through the adapter pattern.
- Cost control systems with token/request limits have been implemented to prevent unexpected expenses.
- GPT-Symbolic feedback loops and rule evaluation mechanisms are now operational.

## Recent Changes

*
- [2025-04-30 12:32:30] - Fixed "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" by implementing robust type checking and conversion in forecast_ensemble.py. Added explicit float() conversion with try/except blocks to handle type conversion errors gracefully with appropriate warning logs.
- [2025-04-30 17:03:00] - Implemented targeted fix for "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in forecast_output/forecast_generator.py by filtering input_features to only include numeric values before passing to the AI model. This addresses the underlying issue at the source by removing string values that the model cannot process.
- [2025-05-02 10:43:00] - Initiated and implemented core components for the Conversational Interface (WIP). This project focuses on a hybrid RAG + lightweight domain-adapter approach for efficient natural language interaction with the Pulse codebase and functionalities. Key implemented parts include the vector store (Sentence-Transformers, Faiss), codebase parsing, vector store building script, placeholder structures for LLM/LoRA integration, the core conversational logic with basic intent recognition and RAG, a basic Tkinter UI, and placeholder Pulse module adapters.
- [2025-05-02 12:20:00] - Enhanced API plugins to write data to file incrementally during ingestion using a new `save_data_point_incremental` function in the `ingestion_persistence` module. This ensures data is preserved even if the ingestion process is interrupted and makes real-time data immediately available to other processes. Modified the AlphaVantage and NASDAQ plugins to use this approach and added a test script to verify the implementation.

## Open Questions/Issues

*
[2025-05-02 11:47:00] - Acquired premium Alpha Vantage API key with 150 requests/minute limit and access to both 15-minute delayed and real-time US stock market data. This provides an opportunity to enhance Pulse's data ingestion and predictive capabilities through more current market data.

[2025-04-30 03:48:31] - Architectural Analysis Summary:
*   **Strengths:** Good high-level modularity (Simulation, Rules, Symbolic, Trust, Memory, Core); extensive feature implementation; sophisticated subsystems; centralized configuration.
*   **Key Concern:** Significant *tight coupling* between core systems (Simulation, Trust, Symbolic, Core) hinders maintainability, testability, and robust evolution, despite the need for interaction for learning. Interactions rely on internal details rather than stable interfaces.
*   **Other Concerns:** Complexity in core orchestrators (`simulator_core`, `TrustEngine`); incomplete features (e.g., full rule-based retrodiction); 24 failing tests indicate stability issues.
*   **Recommendation:** Prioritize refactoring towards **looser coupling** (clearer interfaces, reduced internal dependencies) to support robust learning and evolution. Simplify complex orchestrators and resolve all failing tests.

[2025-05-01 00:37:00] - Recursive AI Training: Future Roadmap:

Following the successful implementation of the Recursive AI Training system with GPT-Symbolic feedback, the following roadmap outlines key future development areas:

**1. Data Robustness Improvements:**
* Schema-change handling and automatic adaptation to evolving data structures
* Automatic detection and handling of distribution shifts in input data
* Robust feature engineering pipeline with automated feature selection
* Cross-validation strategies specifically designed for temporal forecasting
* Data augmentation techniques for rare event simulation

**2. Advanced ML Integration:**
* Neuro-Symbolic Meta-Learning to optimize hyperparameters across recursive cycles
* Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for capturing complex interdependencies in feature space
* Transfer learning between related forecast domains
* Multi-objective optimization for rule generation to balance precision/recall tradeoffs
* Bayesian optimization for the rule enhancement process

**3. Human-in-the-loop Capabilities:**
* Active-Exception Triage system to prioritize human review of edge cases
* Interactive rule editing interface with real-time impact simulation
* Confidence-thresholded automation with routing to human experts
* Feedback collection system to capture domain expertise
* Collaborative filtering of rule suggestions

**4. Explainability Improvements:**
* Provenance Graphs for tracing rule evolution lineage
* Rule contribution analysis to measure impact on forecast accuracy
* Counterfactual explanation generation for rule triggering conditions
* Sensitivity analysis for rule parameters
* Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities for understanding rule behavior

These improvements will further enhance the robustness, accuracy, and usability of the Recursive AI Training system while addressing the current architectural concerns regarding tight coupling and complex orchestration.
[2025-05-01 20:35:00] - Extended data persistence capabilities across API plugins to store data during ingestion. Implemented persistence in NASDAQ, Google Trends, and OpenAQ plugins following the pattern established in the Alpha Vantage plugin. Each plugin now saves request metadata, raw API responses, and processed data to standardized directory structures with timestamps.
[2025-05-02 09:55:00] - Completed the Historical Timeline Project. Implemented phases for Variable and Source Identification, Historical Data Retrieval (including persistence), Data Storage and Standardization (using RecursiveDataStore), Data Verification and Quality Assurance, and Handling Missing Data and Inconsistencies. Developed new modules (`historical_data_retriever.py`, `historical_data_transformer.py`, `historical_data_verification.py`, `historical_data_repair.py`) and enhanced the CLI (`cli_historical_data.py`) to manage the historical data pipeline.
