## Current Focus

*
- Current focus is on resolving skipped tests in the Pulse project's test suite.
- Identified and improved the Graphviz dependency handling in the forecast lineage visualization component.
- Modified the code to provide clearer installation instructions and gracefully handle missing optional dependencies.
- Fixed "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in the forecasting pipeline by implementing proper type conversion and error handling.

## Recent Changes

*
- [2025-04-30 12:32:30] - Fixed "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" by implementing robust type checking and conversion in forecast_ensemble.py. Added explicit float() conversion with try/except blocks to handle type conversion errors gracefully with appropriate warning logs.
- [2025-04-30 17:03:00] - Implemented targeted fix for "Forecast error: must be real number, not str" in forecast_output/forecast_generator.py by filtering input_features to only include numeric values before passing to the AI model. This addresses the underlying issue at the source by removing string values that the model cannot process.

## Open Questions/Issues

[2025-04-30 03:48:31] - Architectural Analysis Summary:
*   **Strengths:** Good high-level modularity (Simulation, Rules, Symbolic, Trust, Memory, Core); extensive feature implementation; sophisticated subsystems; centralized configuration.
*   **Key Concern:** Significant *tight coupling* between core systems (Simulation, Trust, Symbolic, Core) hinders maintainability, testability, and robust evolution, despite the need for interaction for learning. Interactions rely on internal details rather than stable interfaces.
*   **Other Concerns:** Complexity in core orchestrators (`simulator_core`, `TrustEngine`); incomplete features (e.g., full rule-based retrodiction); 24 failing tests indicate stability issues.
*   **Recommendation:** Prioritize refactoring towards **looser coupling** (clearer interfaces, reduced internal dependencies) to support robust learning and evolution. Simplify complex orchestrators and resolve all failing tests.
