# Sprint Plan: Green the Build (Sprint 2)

## Sprint Goal
Continue resolving critical errors and warnings, focusing on fixture issues and common error patterns, to move closer to a stable build.

## Work Items

### GTB2-001
- **Task:** Resolve Missing or Misconfigured Pytest Fixtures
- **Details:** User addressed fixture issues in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_rule_repository.py` and `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_rule_evaluator.py`. Tests in this directory are now largely passing, with remaining failures in `test_rule_generator.py` attributed to non-fixture issues. Broader fixture review for the entire test suite may still be needed if other fixture-related errors surface.
- **Priority:** Highest
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - Primarily `conftest.py` files located throughout the `tests/` directory structure.
  - Individual test files that define or heavily rely on specific fixtures.
- **Assigned_To:** `debug` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`
- **Success_Criteria:**
  - Zero instances of `FixtureMissingError` or `FixtureLookupError` reported by `pytest` across the entire test suite.
  - All tests previously blocked by fixture setup issues now proceed to execution (pass or fail due to other reasons).
  - `pytest` runs to completion without premature termination due to fixture errors.

### GTB2-002
- **Task:** Address `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'enable_dict_compatibility'`
- **Details:** Investigate and resolve the specific `AttributeError` where `'dict'` objects are unexpectedly encountered instead of objects with an `enable_dict_compatibility` method. This involves identifying the root cause (e.g., incorrect object instantiation, API misuse, unexpected data type from a function/method) and implementing the necessary corrections. Python `AttributeError` explicitly stating: `'dict' object has no attribute 'enable_dict_compatibility'`. This is a highlighted key issue.
- **Priority:** Highest
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py` was noted.
  - Other modules interacting with similar adapter patterns, data handling mechanisms, or configurations might also exhibit this error.
- **Assigned_To:** `code` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`
- **Success_Criteria:**
  - The specific error `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'enable_dict_compatibility'` is completely eliminated from `pytest` output.
  - Tests in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py` and any other identified locations previously failing with this specific `AttributeError` now pass or fail for unrelated reasons.

### GTB2-004
- **Task:** Resolve `ImportError` for `validate_variable_trace` in `tests/test_simulator_core.py` and subsequent `TypeError`.
- **Details:** The `ImportError` for `validate_variable_trace` in `tests/test_simulator_core.py` was resolved by refactoring the function. However, this introduced a `TypeError: validate_variable_trace() got an unexpected keyword argument 'steps'` because the refactored function signature in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py` does not match the test's usage. The function signature needs to be corrected or the test call updated.
- **Priority:** Highest (as it blocks full test suite execution)
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - `tests/test_simulator_core.py`
  - `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`
- **Assigned_To:** `code` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`
- **Success_Criteria:**
  - The `ImportError` for `validate_variable_trace` in `tests/test_simulator_core.py` is resolved.
  - `pytest -q` can successfully collect and run tests from `tests/test_simulator_core.py` without this specific import error.
  - The `TypeError` related to the 'steps' argument in `tests/test_simulator_core.py` for `validate_variable_trace` is resolved.
  - The fix passes all configured linting checks.

### GTB2-003
- **Task:** Investigate and Remediate Common `TypeError`s and General `AttributeError`s
- **Details:** Conduct a focused investigation to identify and fix common underlying causes for the prevalent `TypeError`s and general `AttributeError`s (excluding the specific `enable_dict_compatibility` issue). The goal is to find patterns or frequently occurring specific errors within these categories that, if resolved, could fix a significant number of the 46 errors and contribute to reducing the 79 failures. This includes a range of `TypeError`s (e.g., operations on incompatible types, issues with iterables) and `AttributeError`s (e.g., accessing attributes on `NoneType` objects, or unexpected object types leading to missing attributes). Prioritize those that appear most frequently or in critical test modules.
- **Priority:** High
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - This will likely span multiple files across the `tests/` directory and potentially the source code being tested.
  - Analysis of the test failure logs will be needed to pinpoint specific files and modules.
- **Assigned_To:** `debug` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`
- **Success_Criteria:**
  - A significant, measurable reduction (e.g., target a 50% decrease or X fewer occurrences) in the overall count of `TypeError`s reported by `pytest` compared to the pre-sprint baseline.
  - A significant, measurable reduction (e.g., target a 50% decrease or Y fewer occurrences) in the overall count of general `AttributeError`s (excluding the specific `enable_dict_compatibility` issue) reported by `pytest` compared to the pre-sprint baseline.
  - Identification and documented resolution of at least 2-3 common patterns or root causes for these `TypeError`s and `AttributeError`s.
  - A demonstrable decrease in the total number of test failures directly attributable to these categories of errors.
