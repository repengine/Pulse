Pulse: Advanced Learning System Expansion
Pulse’s learning system needs to:

Ingest real-time multi-domain data
Score confidence, trust, and symbolic capital overlays
Persist all reasoning, simulation, and feedback cycles
Adapt rules, weights, and forecasts recursively
Learn not just facts, but strategic meta-patterns across time

Recommended Enhancement Outline

1. Multi-Modal Data Ingestion
Module: data_ingestion.py
Features:
Plug-in system for new data feeds (market, social, political, eco sensors…)
Real-time streaming & historical replay support
Data normalization and semantic enrichment (tag events with narratives, actors, sentiment)

2. Stateful Memory & Trace Architecture
Module: trace_memory.py
Core: A database or object graph that logs:
Every simulation: input state, overlays, actions, outcomes, confidence
Trust scores at each decision/node
Retrospective ground-truth comparisons
Why: This is your “learn from every move” substrate.

3. Recursive Trust-Weighted Learning
Confidence/Trust Loop
Each forecast is assigned a trust score that is updated as reality unfolds.
Trust/weight propagation: forecasts feed into strategy synthesis and are scored by empirical outcomes.
Rewards are assigned not just to predictions, but to reasoning chains and overlays.
4. Meta-Learning Engine
Purpose: Adapt forecasting/overlay strategies, not just parameter weights.
Approach:
Use a combination of:
Reinforcement/Meta-Reinforcement Learning (reward strategies that maximize predictive and strategic utility over time)
Symbolic rule evolution (evolving the overlay rules themselves)
Bayesian / Ensemble learning for trust-weighted aggregation
Each simulation cycle is an “episode” that updates the meta-policy over reasoning chains.

5. Operator-Driven Interactive Learning
Attach high-signal operator feedback to simulation traces:
“Was this simulation trajectory insightful?”
“Did this fork/move expose unseen fragility, or missed overlays?”
Feedback becomes weighted training signal for future runs.

6. Simulation Result Scoring & Pruning
At a set cadence, all simulation cycles are scored:
By empirical outturn, trust-weighted operator feedback, and strategic novelty
Low-value or redundant cycles are pruned for efficiency; high-value traces are used for fine-tuning rules and future exploration seeds.

7. Automated Retrodiction & Self-Critique Loop
Schedule regular retrodiction (backcasting with new overlays/rules on past states)
Log where new strategies outperform (or underperform) legacy traces
Use as feedback to optimize rule and meta-model set
