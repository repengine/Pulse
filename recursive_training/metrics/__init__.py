Recursive Training Metrics Module

This module provides metrics tracking and monitoring capabilities for the 
recursive training system. It includes components for storing, retrieving,
and analyzing metrics data, as well as integration with Pulse's trust system.

Components:
- MetricsStore: Centralized storage for training metrics
- RecursiveTrainingMetrics: Core metrics calculation and tracking
- BayesianAdapter: Integration with Pulse's Bayesian trust system
