1. Current State ("Doesn't do much")‚ÄîIntentional Minimal Viable Sim
From the code, Pulse is architecturally complete but computes modest or stubbed workloads:

Sim cycles go through, but with tiny state/action spaces and superficial overlays.
Data ingest, trust updates, strategy evolution all run‚Äîbut over tiny, abstracted examples.
Minimal resource use‚Äîlikely designed to stress-test only the architecture, interfaces, and feedback loops, not empirical result power yet.
üü¢ This is smart:

You validate design (modularity, pruning, overlays, scoring logic, feedback, trace persistence)
You avoid wasting cloud money or frying workstations on big runs before you‚Äôre SURE the pieces fit and you can analyze outputs meaningfully.
2. What NEEDS to Be in Place Before Scaling Up Simulations?
Checklist: What must be "ready" before big, expensive runs are worth it?

a) Correctness/Audit Trail
Can every sim/fork/trace be fully traced, replayed, and audited?
If a run produces a surprising result, can you pinpoint:
Input data
Overlay/strategy state
Score/utility function applied
Every operator/narrative fork taken?
b) Operator/Feedback Loop Integrity
If you do a million-fork sim, is there any systematic way to surface which forks should be operator-reviewed?
Can feedback/integrity/annotation be done at scale?
e.g., sample runs, "interesting" point identification, anomaly highlighting?
c) Parameter & Model Configurability
Is the sim configuration parameterized enough (via YAML/JSON/CLI) to set up batches of experiments without code edits?
Can you swap in/out overlays, data adapters, scoring functions, etc., via config?
d) Result Summarization/Analytics
Once you finish a large batch:
Can you automatically surface summary statistics (fragility, utility, trust, path diversity, etc.)?
Can you filter out "uninteresting" or repetitive timelines before manual inspection?
Is there a way to sample the result space for diversity?
e) Test/Fail-Safe/Cost Controls
Are there safeguards to pause or kill runaway simulations?
Can you checkpoint, resume, and prune without losing all trace data?
f) Output/Artifacts Handling
Is output well-structured and standardized?
e.g., all results/KPIs to a given schema, ready for dashboards/stats scripts.
Can one extract detailed fork trees for downstream review or operator labeling?
3. What Else Should You Add Before Scaling Up?
Must Haves
Automated Validation & Audit Trail

Build or finalize an audit-trace module: assign IDs to every sim/fork, guarantee reproducibility/logging.
Add integrity checks so nothing is lost or ambiguous at scale.
Result Summarization Logic

Hook summary statistics (per run, per fork, outlier detection, path diversity, etc.).
Build a simple post-sim script or module to crunch/visualize them.
Batch Orchestration + Early Stopping

Batch runner: configs for running many scenarios in parallel.
Set up early warning/abort (if sim coverage, scoring diversity, or resource use exceeds limits, auto-pause).
Run Configuration Loader

Ensure all model params (input data, overlays, scoring, mutator weights) are config file-driven.
Should Haves
Sampling/Filtering & Review Tools

Add "interestingness" metrics (novelty, fragility, trust anomalies) to pre-filter result sets for review.
CLI selector to sample N top-k divergent/fragile/etc. timelines for human loop.
Storage/Serialization Hardening

Confirm output format is robust at tens of thousands‚Äìmillions of objects: e.g. Parquet/Avro, not just raw JSON/CSV.
Could Haves (Optional Pre-Scale)
Notification/Monitoring

Slack/Email alerts on run completion or threshold breach.
Web/API Export

Results can be posted or fetched via endpoints for rapid dashboarding or integration.
4. Final "Are You Ready to Scale?" Checklist
Need	Check
End-to-end traceability?	‚òê
Result summarization?	‚òê
Batch configuration/drivability?	‚òê
Feedback/integrity at scale?	‚òê
Output artifacts robust?	‚òê
Fail-safes/halts/checkpoints?	‚òê
5. Action Recap: What To Build Next
Complete/finalize trace & audit module‚Äîcan always replay a sim and fork, even months later.
Automated result summarization/analytics.
Batch/bulk runner and parameter sweeper (config-driven).
Early stopping/health checks.
Output schema upgrade (robust format).
(Optional) Sampling and ‚Äúinterestingness‚Äù filters.
Once these are done‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre ready for large, costly cycles, and your result/feedback loop will scale with the compute.
