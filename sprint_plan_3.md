# Sprint Plan: Green the Build (Sprint 3)

## Sprint Goal
Continue resolving critical errors and warnings, focusing on module-level AttributeErrors, missing API test fixtures, and TypeErrors in key modules, to significantly improve build stability.

## Work Items

### GTB3-001
- **Task:** Resolve `AttributeError` for `residual_gravity_engine`
- **Details:** Investigate and fix the `AttributeError: module 'symbolic_system.gravity' has no attribute 'residual_gravity_engine'`. This involves verifying the `residual_gravity_engine`'s definition, its import path within the `symbolic_system.gravity` module, and ensuring it's correctly exposed and accessible where used. A fundamental `AttributeError` indicating that a supposedly core component (`residual_gravity_engine`) of the `symbolic_system.gravity` module cannot be found. This type of error can cause widespread failures in any dependent functionality or tests.
- **Priority:** Highest
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - `symbolic_system/gravity/__init__.py`
  - `symbolic_system/gravity/engines/residual_gravity_engine.py` (or wherever it is defined/should be defined)
  - Files importing `symbolic_system.gravity.residual_gravity_engine`, such as `tests/symbolic_system/gravity/test_residual_gravity_engine.py` or `symbolic_system/gravity/symbolic_gravity_fabric.py`.
- **success_criteria:**
  - The `AttributeError: module 'symbolic_system.gravity' has no attribute 'residual_gravity_engine'` is no longer raised during code execution or test runs involving this attribute.
  - `symbolic_system.gravity.residual_gravity_engine` can be successfully imported and utilized by all dependent modules and tests, including but not limited to `tests/symbolic_system/gravity/test_residual_gravity_engine.py` and `symbolic_system/gravity/symbolic_gravity_fabric.py`.
  - All unit tests specifically targeting the functionality of `residual_gravity_engine` pass without error.
  - Code paths that previously triggered this `AttributeError` now execute as expected without this specific error, demonstrating correct integration.
- **Assigned_To:** `code` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`

### GTB3-002
- **Task:** Implement Missing API Test Fixtures
- **Details:** Address failures in API tests by identifying and implementing the missing test fixtures, specifically 'api_key', 'variable_name', and 'plugin_name'. This will likely involve updating `conftest.py` files or individual test setup methods to provide the necessary data or mocks. Multiple API tests are failing due to missing fixtures. This indicates a gap in the test setup, preventing tests from running correctly and potentially masking other issues in the API functionality.
- **Priority:** High
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - `conftest.py` files (e.g., in a root `tests/` directory, or specific `tests/api/` or plugin-related test directories).
  - API test files that are reporting these fixture errors (e.g., tests for various plugins or API endpoints).
- **success_criteria:**
  - API tests that previously failed due to missing 'api_key', 'variable_name', or 'plugin_name' fixtures now execute without these specific fixture-related errors.
  - The test fixtures 'api_key', 'variable_name', and 'plugin_name' are implemented (e.g., in relevant `conftest.py` files or test setup methods) and provide appropriate, valid data or mocks for the tests they serve.
  - All API tests that depend on these newly implemented fixtures complete their execution; test pass/fail status will then depend on the underlying API functionality, not fixture availability.
- **Assigned_To:** `debug` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`

### GTB3-003
- **Task:** Resolve Type Mismatches in `recursive_training` Module
- **Details:** Addressed specific `TypeError` (unsupported t-test) and `AttributeError` ('list' has no 'add') in `tests/recursive_training/advanced_metrics/test_enhanced_metrics.py` and `recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py`. Some tests now pass these specific checks, but other assertion errors and failures remain within the `recursive_training` module, notably in `test_enhanced_metrics.py` and `test_optimized_data_store.py`. These will be considered for future sprints.
- **Priority:** High
- **Potential Files Involved:**
  - Various files within the `recursive_training/` directory, particularly those involved in rule definition, evaluation, and data handling (e.g., `recursive_training/rules/rule_repository.py`, `recursive_training/rules/hybrid_adapter.py`, `recursive_training/data/ingestion_manager.py`).
  - Associated test files like `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_rule_repository.py`, `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_rule_evaluator.py`, `tests/recursive_training/advanced_metrics/test_enhanced_metrics.py`, and `tests/recursive_training/test_optimized_data_store.py`.
- **success_criteria:**
  - The `AttributeError` for `RecursiveDataStore` in `recursive_training/data/ingestion_manager.py` is resolved.
  - The `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'add'` in `tests/recursive_training/advanced_metrics/test_enhanced_metrics.py` is resolved by using `append()` or appropriate list methods.
  - Other identified `TypeError`s and `AttributeError`s within the `recursive_training` module and its tests are resolved.
  - Functions within the `recursive_training` module demonstrate correct and consistent type handling for all parameters and return values, aligning with their documented or intended signatures.
  - All relevant unit tests for the `recursive_training` module, including but not limited to those mentioned in "Potential Files Involved", pass successfully, specifically verifying type consistency and correctness in the areas addressed.
