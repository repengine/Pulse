Pulse Scalability Implementation Plan
=====================================

PHASE 1: Infrastructure Foundation
----------------------------------

1. Containerization
   - Containerize major modules (forecast_engine, simulation_engine, etc.) using Docker.
   - Define Dockerfiles and docker-compose setup for local development.

2. Asynchronous Job Orchestration
   - Integrate Celery with Redis as broker and backend for async task execution.
   - Define tasks for forecast runs, simulation jobs, signal ingestion, etc.

3. Basic Monitoring
   - Add Prometheus metrics exports to major services.
   - Set up Grafana dashboards for task latency, success rates, system load.

PHASE 2: Data Pipeline & Signal Processing
------------------------------------------

1. High-Throughput Signal Ingestion
   - Replace or wrap ingestion logic with Kafka (or Apache Pulsar) producers and consumers.
   - Partition topics by signal type or source.

2. Efficient Storage
   - Store ingested data and processed signals in Parquet format.
   - Organize with Delta Lake structure in AWS S3 or equivalent object store.

3. Caching Strategy
   - Integrate Redis for caching repeated simulation/forecast requests.
   - Add memoization for deterministic function results (e.g., joblib, functools.lru_cache).

PHASE 3: Compute Scaling
------------------------

1. Parallel & Distributed Execution
   - Refactor compute-heavy components to use Ray or Dask.
   - Allow parallel simulations and forecasts based on config/input batches.

2. GPU Support
   - Add support for optional GPU acceleration (e.g., TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch) in forecast engine.

3. Kubernetes Deployment
   - Create Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
   - Set up autoscaling for forecast/simulation pods based on queue length and CPU usage.

PHASE 4: Model Management & Trust System
----------------------------------------

1. Model Registry
   - Integrate MLflow for model tracking, versioning, and deployment.

2. Drift Detection
   - Extend `trust_system` to include statistical checks for model drift.
   - Automate retraining triggers and monitor drift metrics.

3. Forecast Confidence Metrics
   - Enhance `forecast_output` with probabilistic uncertainty ranges and confidence levels.

PHASE 5: Observability & Maintenance
------------------------------------

1. Logging & Tracing
   - Integrate OpenTelemetry or Jaeger for tracing critical workflows.
   - Standardize structured logging across modules.

2. Health Checks
   - Add liveness and readiness probes to all services.
   - Use them to trigger restarts or scaling events in Kubernetes.

3. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Use GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and container builds.
   - Push Docker images to container registry and trigger Helm updates.
