The 4 Does
ðŸ§  System Utility	Does it unlock strategic power or insight?
ðŸ›  Engine Completeness	Does it reduce simulation gaps or missing feedback?
ðŸ“¡ Operator Feedback	Does it improve your experience using Pulse?
ðŸ§ª Trust Loop Integrity	Does it help Pulse learn or test itself better?
- Trust loop integrity is checked by diagnostics/trust_audit.py and trust_system/pulse_mirror_core.py.
- Issues: Trusted but low retrodiction, fragile but trusted, fragile but high confidence.
- See logs for warnings after each simulation batch.
