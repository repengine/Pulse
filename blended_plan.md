# Pulse Blended Plan

## Current Strengths
- Pulse features a modular architecture with core components like the `forecast_engine`, `simulation_engine`, `trust_system`, and `symbolic_system`.
- Extensive testing and CI/CD elements are already in place.
- The existing Pulse Scalability Plan outlines a clear vision across multiple phases.

## Opportunities & Next Build Recommendations

### Phase 1 – Infrastructure Foundation
- Containerize core modules (e.g., `forecast_engine`, `simulation_engine`) with Docker.
- Integrate asynchronous job orchestration using Celery with Redis as broker/backend.
- Implement basic monitoring using Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards.

### Phase 2 – Data Pipeline & Compute Scaling
- Enhance signal ingestion with Kafka or Apache Pulsar.
- Optimize data storage using Parquet and adopt a Delta Lake structure on object storage like AWS S3.
- Introduce distributed compute frameworks (e.g., Ray or Dask) and explore GPU support for compute-intensive tasks.

### Phase 3 – Advanced Capabilities (Mid-term)
- Integrate MLflow for model tracking, versioning, and deployment.
- Extend the trust system with model drift detection and incorporate probabilistic forecast confidence metrics.
- Enhance observability via structured logging, tracing (using OpenTelemetry or Jaeger), and robust CI/CD pipelines.
