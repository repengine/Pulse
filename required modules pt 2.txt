üîç Pulse-Compatible Python Modules for Meta-Learning
1. Pandas (‚úÖ you likely already use)
Purpose: Load and structure large amounts of forecast output and metadata.

Use: Group by variable, overlay, or rule; analyze survival rate, fragility spread, correlation.

2. Scikit-learn
Purpose: Pattern discovery, feature importance, clustering.

Use Cases:

sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest ‚Üí Detect most predictive variables.

sklearn.cluster.KMeans ‚Üí Identify clusters of similar forecasts.

sklearn.metrics.mutual_info_score ‚Üí Variable ‚ÜîÔ∏è Symbolic overlay dependency.

3. NetworkX
Purpose: Graph analysis of causal relationships, symbolic flow, variable co-dependencies.

Use Cases:

Causal rule path mapping

Overlay impact trees

Drift-aware graph deltas between past and present

4. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) ‚Äì for deep transparency
Purpose: Variable importance scoring with explanation power.

Use Cases:

Show which variables contributed most to a simulation‚Äôs success/failure.

Audit symbolic overlays for dominance or bias.

5. Statsmodels
Purpose: Regression, time-series causality, symbolic dominance over time.

Use Cases:

Test overlay volatility with rolling regression.

Symbolic variable trend significance (e.g., Hope decline vs Trust collapse).

6. DVC (Data Version Control) or MLflow (if you're scaling)
Purpose: Track which variable/rule changes led to better simulation outcomes.

Use Cases: Retain interpretability across model evolution.

7. JSON + YAML + Pydantic
Purpose: Structured introspection and memory trace validation.

Use Cases:

Pulse writes forecast metadata to JSON ‚Üí reader validates/ingests ‚Üí schema enforcement.
