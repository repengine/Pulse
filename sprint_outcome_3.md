# Sprint Outcome: Green the Build (Sprint 3)

**Sprint Goal:** Continue resolving critical errors and warnings, focusing on module-level AttributeErrors, missing API test fixtures, and TypeErrors in key modules, to significantly improve build stability.

## Completed Work Items:
*   GTB3-001: Resolve `AttributeError` for `residual_gravity_engine`
*   GTB3-002: Implement Missing API Test Fixtures
*   GTB3-003: Resolve Type Mismatches in `recursive_training` Module (Addressed specific `TypeError` and `AttributeError` instances; other issues remain in the module)

## Final Test Status (`pytest -q` at end of sprint):
*   Passed: 421
*   Failed: 46
*   Errors: 4
*   Warnings: 39

## DoD Lite Check:
*   (a) All imports succeed: Likely OK
*   (b) All tests pass: **Failed**
*   (c) CI linting score >= 9.0: Not Verified (39 warnings remain)
*   (d) MCP smoke works: Not Verified

## Sprint Outcome:
Partially Successful. Key `AttributeError`s, missing API fixtures, and some `TypeError`s were resolved. This led to an increase in passing tests (from 405 to 421), a decrease in failures (from 50 to 46), and a significant decrease in errors (from 12 to 4). However, the build is not yet green due to remaining test failures, errors, and warnings. The sprint goal was not fully met.
