# Sprint Outcome: Green the Build (Sprint 1)

*   **Sprint Name:** Green the Build (Sprint 1)
*   **Sprint Goal:** Resolve critical errors and warnings to achieve a stable build where all tests can be collected and run.
*   **Completed Work Items:**
    *   GTB-001: Fix `IndentationError` in `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py`
    *   GTB-002: Resolve `PytestCollectionWarning`s in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py` (Verified as already addressed)
    *   GTB-003: Investigate and address potential `ImportError` in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py` (Handled optional import)
*   **Final Test Status (`pytest -q`):**
    *   Passed: 319
    *   Failed: 79
    *   Errors: 46
    *   Warnings: 33
    *   Total: 444 (Note: This count excludes tests from the file initially causing the collection error, as reported by Debug mode)
*   **DoD Lite Check:**
    *   (a) All imports succeed: Likely OK (based on collection success)
    *   (b) All tests pass: **Failed**
    *   (c) CI linting score >= 9.0: Not Verified
    *   (d) MCP smoke works: Not Verified
*   **Sprint Outcome:** Partially Successful. Test collection was unblocked by fixing the critical `IndentationError`. However, the build is not green due to numerous test failures and errors. The sprint goal was not fully met.
