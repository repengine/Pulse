# Sprint Plan: Green the Build (Sprint 1)

## Sprint Goal
Resolve critical errors and warnings to achieve a stable build where all tests can be collected and run.

## Work Items

### GTB-001
- **Task:** Fix `IndentationError` in `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py`
- **Details:** Correct the indentation at or around line 223 in `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py` to resolve the `IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level`. This is blocking all test execution.
- **Priority:** Highest
- **Files involved:**
  - `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py`
- **Assigned_To:** `code` # Tentative
- **Status:** `To Do`
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Running `pytest -q` no longer shows an `IndentationError` originating from `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py`.
  - Pytest successfully collects all tests from `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py`.
  - All tests within `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py` execute without interruption from the previously identified `IndentationError`.
  - The code changes made to fix the indentation in `tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py` pass all configured linting checks.

### GTB-002
- **Task:** Resolve `PytestCollectionWarning`s in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py`
- **Details:** Refactor `TestCondition` (around line 115) and `TestAction` (around line 122) in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py` to remove or correctly handle their `__init__` constructors so pytest can collect them. This will ensure tests within these classes are run.
- **Priority:** High
- **Files involved:**
  - `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py`
- **Assigned_To:** `code` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Running `pytest -q` no longer shows `PytestCollectionWarning`s for `TestCondition` or `TestAction` in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py`.
  - Pytest successfully collects any tests defined within the `TestCondition` and `TestAction` classes (if they are intended to be test classes and contain tests).
  - All tests in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py` are collected and can be run by pytest.
  - The refactoring of `__init__` methods in `tests/recursive_training/rules/test_hybrid_adapter.py` passes all configured linting checks.

### GTB-003
- **Task:** Investigate and address potential `ImportError` in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`
- **Details:** Examine the `try-except ImportError` block for `tag_symbolic_state` (lines 72-74) in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`. Determine if the import is critical, ensure the module is available, or implement robust error handling if the import can legitimately fail.
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Files involved:**
  - `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`
- **Assigned_To:** `code` # Tentative
- **Status:** `Done`
- **Success Criteria:**
  - A clear determination is documented regarding whether the `tag_symbolic_state` import in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py` is essential for core functionality or optional.
  - If the import is deemed essential:
    - The `ImportError` for `tag_symbolic_state` is resolved, either by ensuring the dependency is available and correctly imported, or by correcting the import statement.
    - Code relying on `tag_symbolic_state` executes without import errors during relevant operations.
  - If the import is deemed optional:
    - The `try-except ImportError` block in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py` provides robust handling (e.g., logs a clear message, activates a defined fallback behavior) when `tag_symbolic_state` cannot be imported.
    - The application remains stable and functional (possibly with reduced capabilities if it's a fallback) when the import fails.
  - Any code changes made in `simulation_engine/simulator_core.py` pass all configured linting checks.
  - Relevant unit or integration tests confirm the correct behavior of the code related to `tag_symbolic_state`, whether the import succeeds or fails (if optional and handled).
