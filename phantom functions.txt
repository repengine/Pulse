# Phantom Function Catcher v2 Report (Pulse Codebase)

---

## ‚ùå Missing Function: summarize_mutation_log

- Closest Candidates:
  - compress_episode_chain (94%) [Pulse/forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py]
  - summarize_chain_arcs (89%) [Pulse/forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py]
  - tag_symbolic_instability (86%) [Pulse/forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py]

- Recommended Action:
  - Create summarize_mutation_log() by wrapping compress_episode_chain().

---

## ‚ùå Missing Function: ActiveExperimentationEngine

- No close candidates found.

---

## ‚ùå Missing Function: Adam

- No close candidates found.

---

## ‚ùå Missing Function: RuleRegistry

- Closest Candidates:
  - VariableRegistry (92%) [Pulse/variables/variable_registry.py]

- Recommended Action:

# üìã Overall Stats

| Category | Value |
|:---------|:------|
| Total missing functions detected | 106 |
| Phantoms with strong fix suggestions | 78 |
| Phantoms with no good match | 28 |

---

# üìã Notes:
- Some missing functions like `Adam`, `DataFrame`, `DBSCAN`, etc. **come from external libraries** (PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.) and require standard imports, not code fixes.
- Some missing functions appear to be **planned future modules** (`PulseGrow`, `AdvancedLearningEngine`, etc.).
- Core actionable ones (e.g., `summarize_mutation_log`) have clear fix paths.
- This scan **respects subdirectories** fully ‚Äî everything under `Pulse/` was included.

---

# üß† Recommendations:
- **Patch critical phantoms first** (like summarize_mutation_log) to unblock key modules.
- **Mark "future expansion"** for planned engines (like ActiveExperimentationEngine).
- **Standardize imports** for obvious external phantoms (like Adam, DataFrame, etc.).
- **Optionally rerun PFCv2** after big refactors to keep Pulse clean.
