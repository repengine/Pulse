# Sprint Outcome: Sprint 6 - Core Functionality Stabilization II

## Sprint Goal
Address critical blockers identified from Sprint 5 `pytest` failures to stabilize core functionalities related to data ingestion and MCP integration.

## Sprint Summary
Sprint 6 successfully addressed all planned work items, leading to a reduction in critical test failures.

### Completed Work Items:
-   **GTB6-001:** Resolved `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError` in `tests/ingestion/test_incremental_ingestion.py::test_high_frequency_store`. The test now passes (with a new `PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` noted for later refinement).
-   **GTB6-002:** Fixed `RuntimeError` in `tests/test_context7_integration.py::TestContext7Integration::test_development_mode` by correcting the mock target. The test now passes.
-   **GTB6-003:** Addressed `KeyError: 'test_source'` in `tests/recursive_training/test_data_ingestion.py::TestRecursiveDataIngestionManager::test_process_data` by updating the test fixture. The test now passes.

### Test Suite Status at End of Sprint:
-   **Passed:** 434
-   **Failed:** 24
-   **Warnings:** 40

*(To be filled in by Thinking mode in a subsequent step if required by the overall plan - for now, leave as a placeholder or omit if not part of standard sprint outcome)*

## Learnings & Next Steps
Sprint 6 successfully resolved 3 critical blockers, reducing the number of failed tests from 27 to 24. The focus for Sprint 7 will be to continue addressing the remaining 24 failures to move closer to a green build. The `PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` introduced in GTB6-001 should be noted for a future refinement sprint.
