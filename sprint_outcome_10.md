# Sprint 10 Outcome

**Sprint Goal:** Continue to reduce the number of failing tests by addressing issues in the `recursive_training` module, specifically focusing on `AdvancedFeatureProcessor` and `RecursiveDataIngestionManager`.

**Start Date:** 2025-05-12
**End Date:** 2025-05-12

## Sprint Summary

Sprint 10 successfully addressed all three planned test failures in the `recursive_training` module.

*   **Tasks Completed:** 3
    *   **GTB10-001:** Fixed `test_process` in `TestAdvancedFeatureProcessor` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_process` failure (mock for `apply_time_frequency_decomposition` not called) was resolved. The `unittest.mock.patch` decorators in [`tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py) were updated to correctly target the functions where they are imported and used within the `recursive_training.data.advanced_feature_processor` module.
    *   **GTB10-002:** Fixed `test_process_with_disabled_techniques` in `TestAdvancedFeatureProcessor` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_process_with_disabled_techniques` failure (mock for `apply_time_frequency_decomposition` not called) was resolved. The `unittest.mock.patch` target in the `with` statement in [`tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py) was updated to correctly target the function where it is imported and used within the `recursive_training.data.advanced_feature_processor` module (i.e., `'recursive_training.data.advanced_feature_processor.apply_time_frequency_decomposition'`).
    *   **GTB10-003:** Fixed `test_get_cost_summary` in `TestRecursiveDataIngestionManager` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_data_ingestion.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_data_ingestion.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_get_cost_summary` failure, initially a floating-point precision issue (fixed with `pytest.approx`), subsequently failed with `KeyError: 'token_usage'`. This was resolved by correcting the key used in the `get_cost_summary` method in [`recursive_training/data/ingestion_manager.py`](recursive_training/data/ingestion_manager.py) to 'token_usage' when populating the per-source summary information.

*   **Test Suite Status (End of Sprint 10):**
    *   Passed: 448
    *   Failed: 10
    *   Warnings: 40
    *   (Previous baseline at start of Sprint 10: 13 Failed, 445 Passed)

## Key Outcomes & Learnings

*   Successfully resolved 3 test failures in the `recursive_training` module.
*   The number of failing tests in the suite decreased from 13 to 10.
*   Correctly targeting `unittest.mock.patch` to where a function is *used* rather than *defined* was a key learning for the `AdvancedFeatureProcessor` tests.
*   Ensuring correct dictionary key usage resolved the `KeyError` in `RecursiveDataIngestionManager`.

## Remaining Failing Tests (10)

(Based on `pytest -q` output from 2025-05-12, after GTB10-003 fix)

1.  `tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py::TestS3DataStore::test_store_dataset_s3`
2.  `tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py::TestS3DataStore::test_fallback_to_parent_methods`
3.  `tests/recursive_training/test_streaming_data_store.py::TestStreamingDataStore::test_streaming_with_filtering`
4.  `tests/recursive_training/test_streaming_data_store.py::TestStreamingDataStore::test_streaming_with_pyarrow`
5.  `tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py::TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics::test_calculate_f1_score`
6.  `tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py::TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics::test_evaluate_rule_performance`
7.  `tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py::TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics::test_get_performance_summary`
8.  `tests/test_ai_forecaster.py::TestAIForecaster::test_predict_default`
9.  `tests/test_rule_adjustment.py::TestRuleAdjustment::test_adjust_rules_from_learning`
10. `tests/test_trust_engine_risk.py::TestRiskScoring::test_compute_risk_score_no_memory`

**Next Steps:**
*   Plan Sprint 11, focusing on the next set of high-priority failing tests, likely starting with the `S3DataStore` and `StreamingDataStore` issues.
*   Review the 40 warnings if time permits during Sprint 11.
