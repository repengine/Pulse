# Sprint 12 Outcome

**Sprint Goal:** Address all failing tests in `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py)) to improve the reliability of metrics calculation and reduce the number of failing tests in the suite.

**Start Date:** 2025-05-12
**End Date:** 2025-05-12

## Sprint Summary

Sprint 12 successfully addressed all three planned test failures in the `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics` class, along with a regression that was introduced and subsequently fixed.

*   **Tasks Completed:** 4
    *   **GTB12-001:** Fixed `test_calculate_f1_score` in `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_calculate_f1_score` failure (`assert 0.6 == 0.75`) was resolved. The root cause was a local import of `sklearn.metrics` within the `calculate_f1_score` method in [`recursive_training/metrics/training_metrics.py`](recursive_training/metrics/training_metrics.py) that shadowed the mocked module. Removing the local import allowed the test's mock to take effect.
    *   **GTB12-REG001 (Regression Fix):** Fixed `test_store_dataset_s3` in `TestS3DataStore` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py)).
        *   **Details:** A regression (`AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'parent'`) was introduced in `test_store_dataset_s3` after the GTB12-001 fix. This was resolved by ensuring the mock for `_get_optimized_storage_path` returned a `pathlib.Path` object and adjusting related mock assertions in [`tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py).
    *   **GTB12-002:** Fixed `test_evaluate_rule_performance` in `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_evaluate_rule_performance` failure (`AssertionError: assert 'accuracy' in {'mse': -50.0}`) was resolved. The `evaluate_rule_performance` method in [`recursive_training/metrics/training_metrics.py`](recursive_training/metrics/training_metrics.py) was updated to calculate and return all expected metrics (mse, mae, r2_score, f1_score, accuracy, precision, recall) when called with actual and predicted values. It was also updated to correctly handle calls with a rule type string, returning appropriate historical data or error structures.
    *   **GTB12-003:** Fixed `test_get_performance_summary` in `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_get_performance_summary` failure (`assert 12.4999999999999996 == 12.5`) was resolved. The fix involved using `pytest.approx` for the floating-point comparison in the test, adding `import pytest`, correctly configuring `training_metrics.config['summary_rule_types']` in the test, and updating the `get_performance_summary` method in the source code to correctly populate rule performance data.

*   **Test Suite Status (End of Sprint 12):**
    *   Passed: 455
    *   Failed: 3
    *   Warnings: 40
    *   (Previous baseline at start of Sprint 12: 6 Failed, 452 Passed)

## Key Outcomes & Learnings

*   Successfully resolved all 3 targeted test failures in `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics`.
*   Successfully fixed 1 regression that occurred during the sprint.
*   The number of failing tests in the suite decreased from 6 to 3.
*   Key fixes involved correcting mock scopes, ensuring methods return all expected data, and using appropriate float comparison techniques (`pytest.approx`).

## Remaining Failing Tests (3)

(Based on `pytest -q` output from 2025-05-12, after GTB12-003 fix)

1.  [`tests/test_ai_forecaster.py::TestAIForecaster::test_predict_default`](tests/test_ai_forecaster.py)
2.  [`tests/test_rule_adjustment.py::TestRuleAdjustment::test_adjust_rules_from_learning`](tests/test_rule_adjustment.py)
3.  [`tests/test_trust_engine_risk.py::TestRiskScoring::test_compute_risk_score_no_memory`](tests/test_trust_engine_risk.py)

---

**Next Steps:**
*   Plan Sprint 13, focusing on the remaining 3 failing tests.
*   Consider addressing the 40 warnings if time permits.
