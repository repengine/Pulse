# Sprint 8 Outcome

**Sprint Goal:** Address critical blockers identified from Sprint 7's `pytest` failures to improve system stability and core functionality, focusing on metrics, data storage, and integration error handling.

**Sprint Duration:** 2025-05-12 to 2025-05-12 (1 day)

**Completed Tasks:**
*   **GTB8-001: Fix MetricsStore Singleton Pattern**
    *   Summary: The `test_singleton_pattern` failure (AssertionError: Expected `__init__` to have been called once. Called 0 times) was resolved by resetting `MetricsStore._instance = None` in the test setup. Additionally, `test_export_to_dataframe` was fixed by removing a local pandas import in [`recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py`](recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py). The `test_track_cost` still fails but is likely a separate mock setup issue within that specific test.
*   **GTB8-002: Fix RecursiveDataStore Cleanup Test**
    *   Summary: The `TestRecursiveDataStore::test_cleanup` failure (previously `AssertionError: assert 1 == 2`) was resolved. The test was enhanced with a `smart_glob_side_effect` for `pathlib.Path.glob` and specific assertions for `os.remove` and `Path.rmdir` calls, ensuring the cleanup logic is now correctly verified. A syntax error from a previous diff application was also corrected.
*   **GTB8-003: Fix Context7Integration Error Handling**
    *   Summary: The `TestContext7Integration::test_error_handling` failure (`AssertionError: ValueError not raised`) was resolved. The `get_library_documentation` function in [`utils/context7_client.py`](utils/context7_client.py) was modified to correctly catch and re-raise exceptions originating from MCP tool calls as `ValueError`, ensuring the test's expectation is met. This involved restructuring the try-except blocks.

**Test Results Summary:**
*   Tests Passed: 441
*   Tests Failed: 17 (down from 19 at the start of the sprint)
*   Warnings: 40

**Key Changes & Observations:**
*   Successfully fixed the `MetricsStore` singleton pattern test (`test_singleton_pattern`) and a related `test_export_to_dataframe` by correcting test setup and removing a local import from [`recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py`](recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py).
*   Successfully fixed the `RecursiveDataStore` cleanup test (`test_cleanup`) by correcting a syntax error from a previous diff and ensuring the existing sophisticated mock setup correctly verifies file/directory deletions in [`tests/recursive_training/test_data_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_data_store.py).
*   Successfully fixed the `Context7Integration` error handling test (`test_error_handling`) by ensuring `ValueError` is consistently propagated from underlying MCP errors in [`utils/context7_client.py`](utils/context7_client.py).
*   The number of failing tests decreased from 19 to 17.

**Remaining Blockers/Issues:**
*   The `TestAdvancedFeatureProcessor` tests (GTB7-002) in [`tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py) remain blocked due to TensorFlow compatibility.
*   The `test_track_cost` in [`tests/recursive_training/test_metrics_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_metrics_store.py) is still failing and needs separate investigation.
*   The following 15 tests are also still failing:
    *   `FAILED [tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py](tests/recursive_training/test_advanced_feature_processor.py)::TestAdvancedFeatureProcessor::test_process - AssertionError: Expected 'apply_time_frequency_decomposition' to be called once. Called 0 times.`
