use gpt to run historical retrodiction simulations, like its Pulse if Pulse was perfect, to compare notes with Pulse

an intelligence system that links all of the modules together. run any function, streamline the order, run recursive learning and AI training of Pulse with token limit settings.

new ui

REVIEW DATA INGESTION/VARIABLES/RULES/GROUND-TRUTH DATA FOR HISTORICAL RETRODICTION

begin learning?


things the intelligence must do:

call all functions as needed. (must decide how?)

"is confidence growth slowing? do i need to adjust trust, symbolism, variables/rules, signal, etc?"
"is forecast accuracy very high? can i try new variables to predict?"


UI where operator can decide. with auto run
