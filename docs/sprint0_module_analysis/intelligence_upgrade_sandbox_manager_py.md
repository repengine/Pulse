# Analysis Report: `intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:1) module is to manage "epistemic upgrade proposals." It provides a sandboxed environment where these proposals can be submitted, stored, listed, and retrieved for review before they are potentially promoted based on a trust-gated process. Essentially, it acts as a staging area for changes or improvements to the system's knowledge or operational logic.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope:
*   Submitting new upgrade proposals.
*   Listing pending upgrade IDs.
*   Retrieving details of a specific upgrade.

There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass` statements in critical logic) or "TODO" comments within the core functionality. The error handling for file I/O and JSON parsing is present, printing messages to the console and, in some cases, raising exceptions or returning empty/None values.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **No Promotion Mechanism:** The module's description mentions "before trust-gated promotion," but there is no functionality within this module to handle the actual promotion, approval, rejection, or deletion of upgrades. This implies a significant next step or a separate module is required to complete the lifecycle of an upgrade proposal.
*   **No Update/Edit Functionality:** Once an upgrade is submitted, there's no way to modify it through this manager.
*   **Scalability of Storage:** Storing all proposals in a single JSONL file ([`pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35)) might become inefficient for a very large number of proposals, especially for retrieval ([`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87) which reads the file line by line). A more robust storage solution (e.g., a database, or sharded files) might be needed in the future.
*   **Error Handling Strategy:** The current error handling ([`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:55-58), [`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:79-84), [`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:109-115)) prints messages and sometimes re-raises `IOError` or returns `None`/`[]`. A more structured error/exception strategy might be beneficial for programmatic consumers of this manager. The comment in [`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:57) ("Depending on desired error handling, you might re-raise or return a specific error indicator") suggests this was considered but not fully decided.
*   **Lack of Metadata:** The stored upgrades don't include timestamps for submission or any status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:**
    *   [`from intelligence.intelligence_config import UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:20): Imports the directory path for storing sandbox data.
*   **External library dependencies:**
    *   [`json`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:16): Used for serializing and deserializing upgrade data to/from JSON format.
    *   [`os`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:17): Used for path manipulation ([`os.path.join()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35), [`os.path.exists()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:70)) and directory creation ([`os.makedirs()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:34)).
    *   [`uuid`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:18): Used to generate unique IDs for upgrade proposals ([`uuid.uuid4()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:49)).
    *   [`typing`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:19): Used for type hinting (`Dict`, `Any`, `List`, `Optional`).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   The module interacts with the file system by creating a directory specified by `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` and reading/writing to [`pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35) within that directory. Other modules involved in the "trust-gated promotion" would presumably read from this file.
*   **Input/output files:**
    *   **Input/Output:** [`<UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR>/pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35) - This file is used to store submitted upgrade proposals in JSONL format. It's an output for [`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37) and an input for [`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61) and [`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module includes a standalone test block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) that demonstrates basic usage:

```python
# Example from intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119-131
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("[UpgradeSandbox] ðŸš€ Running standalone sandbox test...")
    sandbox: UpgradeSandboxManager = UpgradeSandboxManager()
    dummy_upgrade: Dict[str, Any] = {
        "proposed_variables": ["hope_drift", "trust_collapse"],
        "proposed_consequences": ["market_stability_shift"],
        "notes": "Test upgrade example."
    }
    upgrade_id: str = sandbox.submit_upgrade(dummy_upgrade)
    print("[UpgradeSandbox] Pending upgrades:", sandbox.list_pending_upgrades())
    if upgrade_id:
        details: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = sandbox.get_upgrade_details(upgrade_id)
        print("[UpgradeSandbox] Details for upgrade:", details)
```

**Class:** [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22)
*   **Initialization:** `manager = UpgradeSandboxManager(sandbox_dir="/custom/path/to/sandbox")` or `manager = UpgradeSandboxManager()` to use the default from `intelligence_config`.
*   **Submitting an upgrade:** `upgrade_id = manager.submit_upgrade({"key": "value", "description": "New proposal"})`
*   **Listing pending upgrades:** `pending_ids = manager.list_pending_upgrades()`
*   **Getting upgrade details:** `details = manager.get_upgrade_details("some-uuid-string")`

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **File Name:** The name of the file storing pending upgrades, `"pending_upgrades.jsonl"`, is hardcoded within the `__init__` method ([`self.pending_upgrades_path = os.path.join(self.sandbox_dir, "pending_upgrades.jsonl")`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35)). While the directory is configurable via `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR`, the filename itself is not. This is a minor issue but reduces flexibility if different storage schemes or filenames were desired without code changes.
*   **Default `upgrade_id` value in `list_pending_upgrades`:** If an `upgrade_id` is missing from a JSON line, it defaults to the string `"unknown"` ([`upgrades.append(upgrade.get("upgrade_id", "unknown"))`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:77)). This is a default value for a missing key, which is reasonable, but worth noting.
*   **Print Prefixes:** The console output messages use hardcoded prefixes like `"[Sandbox] âœ…"` or `"[UpgradeSandbox] ðŸš€"` (e.g., [`print(f"[Sandbox] âœ… Upgrade proposal {upgrade_id} submitted.")`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:54)). For more robust logging, these might be better handled by a dedicated logging mechanism.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **`intelligence.intelligence_config`:** Tightly coupled to this module for the `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` configuration. Changes to how this configuration is provided would require changes here.
*   **File System & Format:** The module is tightly coupled to the file system for storage and the JSONL format for data serialization. Any module that consumes these proposals must also understand this format and file location. The "trust-gated promotion" system is implicitly coupled here.
*   **Error Reporting:** Relies on `print()` for error reporting, coupling it to console-based monitoring. A more decoupled logging system would be an improvement.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   The module contains a basic `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119-131`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119)) which acts as a simple integration/smoke test for its core functionalities.
*   Based on the file listing provided for the `tests/` directory, there does **not** appear to be a dedicated test file (e.g., `test_upgrade_sandbox_manager.py`) for this module. This indicates a gap in formal unit testing coverage.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module is designed around a single class, [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22).
    *   The constructor ([`__init__()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:26)) initializes the sandbox directory path and ensures the directory exists. It also defines the full path to the `pending_upgrades.jsonl` file.
*   **Control Flow:**
    1.  **Submission ([`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37)):**
        *   Generates a unique `upgrade_id`.
        *   Adds this ID to the input `upgrade_data`.
        *   Appends the JSON-serialized `upgrade_data` as a new line to `pending_upgrades.jsonl`.
        *   Handles potential `IOError` during file writing.
    2.  **Listing ([`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61)):**
        *   Checks if `pending_upgrades.jsonl` exists.
        *   Reads the file line by line.
        *   For each line, attempts to parse it as JSON.
        *   Extracts the `upgrade_id` from each valid JSON object.
        *   Handles `IOError` during file reading and `json.JSONDecodeError` for individual lines, continuing to process other lines if a decode error occurs.
    3.  **Retrieval ([`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87)):**
        *   Checks if `pending_upgrades.jsonl` exists.
        *   Reads the file line by line.
        *   For each line, attempts to parse it as JSON.
        *   If the `upgrade_id` in the parsed data matches the requested ID, returns the data.
        *   Handles `IOError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` similarly to the listing method.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22) follows PascalCase, which is standard for Python classes (PEP 8).
*   **Method Names:** [`submit_upgrade`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37), [`list_pending_upgrades`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61), [`get_upgrade_details`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87) use snake_case, which is standard for Python functions and methods (PEP 8).
*   **Variable Names:** Generally use snake_case (e.g., `sandbox_dir`, `upgrade_data`, `upgrade_id`). This is consistent with PEP 8.
*   **Configuration Constant:** `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` (imported from [`intelligence.intelligence_config`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:20)) is in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, standard for constants.
*   **Internal Paths:** `pending_upgrades_path` is descriptive.
*   **Type Hinting:** Uses standard types from the `typing` module (e.g., `Dict`, `Any`, `List`, `Optional`).
*   **Docstrings:** The module, class, and methods have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values, which is good practice.
*   **Print Messages:** The prefixes in print statements like `"[Sandbox] âœ…"` are consistent within their context.

No significant deviations from PEP 8 or obvious AI assumption errors in naming were observed. The naming is clear and consistent.
