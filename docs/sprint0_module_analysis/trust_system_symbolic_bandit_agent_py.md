# Analysis of trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py

**Module Path:** [`trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py`](trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:495)

**Original Line Number in Inventory:** 495

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose
The module provides a basic implementation of a multi-armed bandit agent, specifically using an Epsilon-Greedy strategy for action selection.
- **`SymbolicBanditAgent` class:**
    - Initializes with a set of possible `actions`.
    - Keeps track of `counts` (how many times each action has been taken) and `values` (the estimated average reward for each action).
    - `select_action()`: Implements Epsilon-Greedy. With a probability of epsilon (hardcoded to 0.1), it explores by choosing a random action. Otherwise, it exploits by choosing the action with the highest current estimated value.
    - `update(action, reward)`: Updates the count and estimated value for the chosen `action` based on the received `reward`, using an incremental average formula.

The \"Symbolic\" prefix in the class name suggests it's intended to be used in a system where actions or states have symbolic representations or implications, possibly within the broader \"trust_system\" to make decisions about which symbolic rules, models, or strategies to trust or employ.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness
- The module is a complete and functional implementation of a basic Epsilon-Greedy bandit agent.
- There are no `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders for core logic.
- It's a very concise and standard implementation of this algorithm.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
- **Signs of intended extension:**
    - The \"Symbolic\" naming implies a potential for more sophisticated integration with symbolic reasoning systems than what is currently present. The current agent is generic and doesn't inherently process or understand \"symbols.\"
    - Could be extended with other bandit algorithms (e.g., UCB1, Thompson Sampling) or more complex state/context handling if it were to become a \"Contextual Bandit.\"
- **Implied but missing features/modules:**
    - The agent itself is a general tool. Its specific application within the `trust_system` (what the `actions` represent, how `rewards` are determined based on trust metrics) is not defined within this module and would be implemented by the calling code.
    - No mechanism for decaying epsilon (exploration rate) over time, which is a common refinement.
- **Indications of deviated/stopped development:**
    - No direct indications. It's a simple, self-contained utility. Its simplicity might mean it's a foundational piece, or it might be an early version that could be expanded.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies
- **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    - None. This module is self-contained in terms of project-specific code.
- **External library dependencies:**
    - `random` ([`trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:1`](trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:1)) (Python standard library) for `random.random()` and `random.choice()`.
- **Interaction with other modules:**
    - This agent is designed to be used by other modules within the `trust_system` or related systems.
    - The calling module would be responsible for:
        - Defining the set of `actions`.
        - Calling `select_action()` to get the agent's decision.
        - Executing the chosen action in the environment.
        - Determining the `reward` based on the outcome of the action.
        - Calling `update()` with the action and reward.
- **Input/output files:**
    - Does not directly read from or write to files. Operates on in-memory state.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages
- **`SymbolicBanditAgent`:**
  ```python
  # from trust_system.symbolic_bandit_agent import SymbolicBanditAgent
  import random # For reward simulation

  # Define a set of possible actions (e.g., different strategies to apply)
  possible_actions = ["strategy_A", "strategy_B", "strategy_C"]
  agent = SymbolicBanditAgent(actions=possible_actions)

  # Simulate a few rounds of interaction
  for i in range(100):
      chosen_action = agent.select_action()
      print(f"Round {i+1}: Agent chose {chosen_action}")

      # Simulate a reward (e.g., based on how well the chosen strategy performed)
      # This reward logic would be specific to the application
      if chosen_action == "strategy_A":
          reward = 1.0 if random.random() < 0.7 else 0.0 # 70% chance of success
      elif chosen_action == "strategy_B":
          reward = 1.0 if random.random() < 0.5 else 0.0 # 50% chance of success
      else: # strategy_C
          reward = 1.0 if random.random() < 0.3 else 0.0 # 30% chance of success

      agent.update(chosen_action, reward)
      print(f"  Updated with reward: {reward}. Current values: {agent.values}")

  print("\\nFinal estimated values for actions:", agent.values)
  print("Times each action was chosen:", agent.counts)
  best_action = agent.select_action() # After learning, this is more likely to be the best one
  print(f"Agent's best action after learning (mostly exploitation): {best_action}")
  ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues
- **Epsilon Value:** The exploration rate (epsilon) is hardcoded to `0.1` ([`trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:11`](trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:11)). This is a critical parameter for the Epsilon-Greedy algorithm and should ideally be configurable, possibly with a decay schedule.
- **Initialization of Values:** Action values are initialized to `0.0` ([`trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:7`](trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py:7)). While common, optimistic initialization (starting values higher) can sometimes encourage more initial exploration. This could be a configurable option.

## 7. Coupling Points
- The agent is fairly decoupled. Its main interaction points are:
    - The `actions` list provided during initialization.
    - The `reward` signal provided by the environment/calling code.
- The nature of the `actions` (e.g., strings, objects) and the scale/meaning of `reward` are determined externally.

## 8. Existing Tests
- A search for `tests/test_symbolic_bandit_agent.py` yielded no results. This suggests that dedicated unit tests for this module, following this common naming pattern, may not exist or are located elsewhere/named differently. Tests would be beneficial to verify the Epsilon-Greedy logic and the update rule.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow
- **Class `SymbolicBanditAgent`:**
    - **`__init__(self, actions)`:**
        - Stores the list of `actions`.
        - Initializes `counts` (dictionary mapping action to 0).
        - Initializes `values` (dictionary mapping action to 0.0).
    - **`select_action(self)`:**
        - Generates a random number.
        - If the number is less than epsilon (0.1), choose a random action from `self.actions` (exploration).
        - Otherwise, choose the action that has the maximum value in `self.values` (exploitation).
        - Returns the chosen action.
    - **`update(self, action, reward)`:**
        - Increments the count for the given `action` in `self.counts`.
        - Retrieves the current count (`n`) and estimated value (`value`) for the `action`.
        - Updates the estimated value for the `action` in `self.values` using the formula: `new_value = old_value + (reward - old_value) / n`. This is the standard incremental sample average update rule.

## 10. Naming Conventions
- **Class:** `SymbolicBanditAgent` (PascalCase) - Standard.
- **Methods:** `__init__`, `select_action`, `update` (snake_case) - Standard.
- **Attributes/Variables:** `actions`, `counts`, `values`, `action`, `reward`, `n`, `value` (snake_case) - Standard.
- The naming is clear and follows Python conventions. The \"Symbolic\" prefix is the only part whose direct relevance isn't immediately obvious from the code itself but is likely tied to its intended use case within the larger system.
