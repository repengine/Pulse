# Module Analysis: `memory/memory_repair_queue.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`memory/memory_repair_queue.py`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:1) module is to re-evaluate forecasts that were previously discarded and logged as "blocked." This re-evaluation is typically triggered by changes in conditions such as symbolic trust shifts, adjustments in license thresholds, or manual operator reviews. The module aims to recover forecasts that might become valid under new criteria.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope. It contains functions to:
*   Load blocked forecasts from a log file.
*   Filter these forecasts based on specific retry reasons.
*   Re-apply licensing logic to them.
*   Export any forecasts that are successfully recovered.

There are no obvious TODO comments or placeholder code sections within the module, suggesting it fulfills its intended basic functionality.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Extensibility for Repair Triggers:** The current implementation focuses on re-evaluating forecasts based on licensing reasons. It could be made more extensive by supporting other types of repair triggers or conditions.
*   **Triggering Mechanism:** The module provides the mechanics for re-evaluation but doesn't include the system or logic that would *trigger* this repair process. An external component or scheduler would be needed to invoke these functions based on events like trust shifts or operator commands.
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:** While basic `try-except` blocks are present for file operations, error handling could be more robust, potentially logging failures to a dedicated error log or notifying an operator.
*   **Configuration:** The path to the blocked memory log is hardcoded. This could be made configurable.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from Project Modules:
*   [`trust_system.license_enforcer.annotate_forecasts`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py)
*   [`trust_system.license_enforcer.filter_licensed`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py)

### External Library Dependencies:
*   `json` (Python standard library)
*   `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, `typing.Optional` (Python standard library)

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:
*   Reads discarded forecast data from a JSONL file, typically [`logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl`](../../../logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl).
*   Writes recovered forecasts to a new JSONL file, the path of which is provided as an argument to the [`export_recovered`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:38) function.

### Input/Output Files:
*   **Input:** [`logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl`](../../../logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl) (default path for blocked forecasts).
*   **Output:** A user-specified JSONL file for recovered forecasts (e.g., `recovered_forecasts.jsonl`).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **[`load_blocked_memory(path: str = BLOCKED_LOG_PATH) -> List[Dict]`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:19):**
    *   Loads a list of forecast dictionaries from the specified JSONL file.
    ```python
    # Example:
    # blocked_forecasts = load_blocked_memory()
    # or
    # blocked_forecasts = load_blocked_memory("custom_path/blocked.jsonl")
    ```

*   **[`filter_for_retry(forecasts: List[Dict], reasons: List[str]) -> List[Dict]`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:28):**
    *   Filters the loaded forecasts, returning only those whose `license_status` field matches one of the provided `reasons`.
    ```python
    # Example:
    # forecasts_to_retry = filter_for_retry(all_blocked_forecasts, ["LICENSE_THRESHOLD_ADJUSTED", "OPERATOR_REVIEW_REQUESTED"])
    ```

*   **[`retry_licensing(blocked: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:32):**
    *   Takes a list of blocked forecasts, re-annotates them using [`annotate_forecasts`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py), and then filters them using [`filter_licensed`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py) to return only the newly licensed (recovered) forecasts.
    ```python
    # Example:
    # recovered_forecasts = retry_licensing(forecasts_to_retry)
    ```

*   **[`export_recovered(forecasts: List[Dict], path: str) -> None`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:38):**
    *   Saves a list of recovered forecast dictionaries to the specified JSONL file.
    ```python
    # Example:
    # export_recovered(recovered_forecasts, "output/newly_recovered.jsonl")
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Log Path:** The default path for the blocked memory log is hardcoded as `BLOCKED_LOG_PATH = "logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl"` ([`memory/memory_repair_queue.py:17`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:17)). While [`load_blocked_memory`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:19) allows overriding this, making it configurable via a settings file or environment variable would be more flexible.
*   **Print Statements:** Status messages in print statements include emojis (e.g., "‚ùå", "üîÅ", "‚úÖ"). While informative for direct script execution, these might not be ideal for automated logging systems.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **`trust_system.license_enforcer`:** The module is tightly coupled with [`annotate_forecasts`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py) and [`filter_licensed`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py) from the [`trust_system.license_enforcer`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py) module. Changes to the logic or signature of these functions would directly impact this module.
*   **Blocked Log Format:** The module assumes a specific JSONL format for the [`logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl`](../../../logs/blocked_memory_log.jsonl) file, particularly expecting a `license_status` key in each JSON object for the [`filter_for_retry`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:28) function.

## 8. Existing Tests

No dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/memory/test_memory_repair_queue.py`) was found during the analysis. This indicates a gap in automated testing for this module. Tests should be created to cover:
*   Loading forecasts from valid and invalid/missing log files.
*   Filtering logic with various reasons and forecast structures.
*   The licensing retry mechanism, potentially using mocks for `annotate_forecasts` and `filter_licensed`.
*   Exporting recovered forecasts and verifying the output.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a straightforward procedural flow:
1.  **Load:** The [`load_blocked_memory`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:19) function reads all previously discarded forecasts from the [`BLOCKED_LOG_PATH`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:17).
2.  **Filter (Optional but Implied):** The [`filter_for_retry`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:28) function selects a subset of these forecasts based on why they might be eligible for re-evaluation (e.g., `license_status` matches given reasons).
3.  **Re-Process:** The [`retry_licensing`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:32) function takes the filtered (or all loaded) forecasts and re-applies the licensing checks using functions from [`trust_system.license_enforcer`](../../../trust_system/license_enforcer.py).
4.  **Export:** The [`export_recovered`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:38) function saves the forecasts that successfully pass the re-licensing step to a new file.

The primary control flow would involve calling these functions sequentially.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Names like [`load_blocked_memory`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:19), [`filter_for_retry`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:28), [`retry_licensing`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:32), and [`export_recovered`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:38) are descriptive and follow Python's `snake_case` convention (PEP 8).
*   **Variables:**
    *   Local variables like `f` (in file operations) and `fc` (in list comprehensions) are short but used in contexts where their meaning is clear.
    *   Other variables like `forecasts`, `reasons`, `blocked`, `repaired`, `path` are descriptive.
*   **Constants:** [`BLOCKED_LOG_PATH`](../../../memory/memory_repair_queue.py:17) is in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is appropriate for constants.
*   **Overall:** The naming conventions are generally consistent and adhere to PEP 8. There are no obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations from standard Python practices.
