# Analysis of `docs/deprecation_policy.md`

## 1. Document Purpose

The primary purpose of [`docs/deprecation_policy.md`](../../docs/deprecation_policy.md:1) is to establish clear guidelines for two critical aspects of the Pulse project's development lifecycle:
*   **Milestone Reviews**: Defining when and how codebase reviews are conducted.
*   **Deprecation Policy**: Outlining the process for identifying, marking, and eventually removing outdated or superseded code modules and functions.

## 2. Key Topics Covered

The document covers the following key topics:

*   **Milestone Reviews**:
    *   **Frequency**: Reviews are mandated at every `v0.X00` version increment.
    *   **Scope**: These reviews involve a comprehensive assessment of the codebase, focusing on refactoring modules to improve clarity, performance, and maintainability.
    *   **Associated Tasks**: Updates to documentation and tests are required as part of the review process.
*   **Deprecation Policy**:
    *   **Identification**: Modules or functions targeted for deprecation must be clearly marked using a `@deprecated` decorator.
    *   **Warning**: A warning message must be included in the docstring of the deprecated code.
    *   **Removal Timeline**: Deprecated code is scheduled for removal after two milestone releases, allowing a grace period for dependent code to be updated. An exception is made if the code is critical for backward compatibility.
    *   **Documentation**: All deprecations must be logged in a central document, [`docs/deprecations.md`](../../docs/deprecations.md:1).

## 3. Intended Audience

This document is primarily intended for:

*   **Developers**: To understand how to manage code lifecycle, when to expect reviews, and how to handle deprecated features.
*   **Project Maintainers**: To enforce consistent review and deprecation processes.
*   **Contributors**: To be aware of the project's standards for code evolution and maintenance.

## 4. Document Structure

The document is concisely structured with a main title and two distinct sections:

*   **`# Pulse Deprecation & Milestone Review Policy`**: Main title.
*   **`## Milestone Reviews`**: Contains three bullet points detailing the review process.
*   **`## Deprecation Policy`**: Contains three bullet points detailing the deprecation process.

The information is presented clearly using headings and bullet points for easy readability.

## 5. Utility for Understanding Pulse Project

This document is highly valuable for understanding the Pulse project's approach to:

*   **Code Quality and Maintenance**: The milestone review policy ensures regular assessment and improvement of the codebase.
*   **Lifecycle Management**: The deprecation policy provides a structured way to evolve the software by phasing out old components while minimizing disruption.
*   **Project Governance**: It establishes clear rules and expectations for developers contributing to or maintaining the project.
*   **Transparency**: Documenting deprecations in a central file ([`docs/deprecations.md`](../../docs/deprecations.md:1)) keeps all stakeholders informed about upcoming changes.

Overall, [`docs/deprecation_policy.md`](../../docs/deprecation_policy.md:1) is a crucial policy document that contributes to the stability, maintainability, and long-term health of the Pulse project.
