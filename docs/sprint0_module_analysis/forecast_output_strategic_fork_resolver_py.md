# Analysis Report: `forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:1) module is to decide between two alternative forecast scenarios, termed "Scenario A" and "Scenario B" (a "strategic fork"). This decision is based on a scoring mechanism that considers alignment, confidence, arc priority (implicitly via [`score_forecast()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0)), and symbolic trust. The module processes pairs of scenarios, selects the preferred one, and provides a rationale for the decision. It also includes functionality to export a summary of these decisions.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope.
*   It has clear functions for scoring options, resolving individual forks, and resolving all forks in a list.
*   It includes an export function for the results.
*   There are no obvious placeholders like `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `pass` statements in unimplemented functions.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Limited Scoring Sophistication:** The current scoring relies entirely on the [`score_forecast()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0) function. While the docstring mentions "alignment, confidence, arc priority, and symbolic trust," it's not explicitly clear how `symbolic trust` or `arc priority` are factored in beyond what [`score_forecast()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0) provides. If these were intended to be distinct, weighted components in the fork resolution, that logic is not present here.
*   **No Handling of "Undecided" Propagation:** The [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30) function can return `"undecided"` if data is missing. However, there's no higher-level logic apparent in this module to handle or escalate such cases. Downstream processes would need to be aware of and manage these undecided forks.
*   **Basic Rationale:** The reason for a decision is simply the scores: `f"Score A={scores['A']} vs B={scores['B']}"`. More sophisticated rationale, perhaps detailing which components of the score contributed most to the difference, could be a potential extension.
*   **Implicit Data Structure:** The module expects input `pair` dictionaries with a specific structure (`"scenario_a": {"forecast": {...}}`). While functional, this isn't formally defined (e.g., using Pydantic models), which could be a future improvement for robustness.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:**
    *   [`from forecast_output.forecast_prioritization_engine import score_forecast`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:14)
    *   [`from forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier import classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:15)
*   **External library dependencies:**
    *   `typing` (standard library): Used for `Dict`, `List`.
    *   `json` (standard library): Used in [`export_fork_decision_summary()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:65) for saving results.
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   The module consumes forecast data structures that are presumably generated by other parts of the `forecast_output` or `forecast_engine` systems.
    *   The [`score_forecast()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0) and [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:0) functions imply interaction with the logic and data expectations of those modules.
*   **Input/output files:**
    *   **Input:** Expects a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a pair of scenarios (`dual_scenarios` in [`resolve_all_forks()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:55)). The structure of these dictionaries is implicitly defined by how [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30) accesses them (e.g., `pair.get("scenario_a", {}).get("forecast")`).
    *   **Output:** The [`export_fork_decision_summary()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:65) function writes a JSON file containing the list of decision summaries. The path for this file is an argument to the function.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **[`score_fork_options(a: Dict, b: Dict) -> Dict[str, float]`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:18):**
    *   **Purpose:** Scores two individual forecast dictionaries (`a` and `b`).
    *   **Usage:**
        ```python
        forecast_A = {"trace_id": "trace1", "confidence": 0.8, "alignment": 0.9, ...} # Other fields expected by score_forecast
        forecast_B = {"trace_id": "trace2", "confidence": 0.7, "alignment": 0.95, ...}
        scores = score_fork_options(forecast_A, forecast_B)
        # scores might be: {'A': 0.85, 'B': 0.825} (example values)
        ```

*   **[`resolve_fork(pair: Dict) -> Dict`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30):**
    *   **Purpose:** Takes a dictionary containing two scenarios ('scenario_a', 'scenario_b'), scores them, and decides which is better.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```python
        scenario_pair = {
            "scenario_a": {"forecast": {"trace_id": "traceA_001", "confidence": 0.9, "alignment_score": 0.85, "arc_weight": 1.2}},
            "scenario_b": {"forecast": {"trace_id": "traceB_001", "confidence": 0.8, "alignment_score": 0.9, "arc_weight": 1.1}}
        }
        decision_summary = resolve_fork(scenario_pair)
        # decision_summary could be:
        # {
        #     "decision": "A",
        #     "selected_trace_id": "traceA_001",
        #     "reason": "Score A=X.XXX vs B=Y.YYY", # Actual scores
        #     "cluster": "some_cluster_type", # From classify_forecast_cluster
        #     "score": {"A": X.XXX, "B": Y.YYY}
        # }
        ```

*   **[`resolve_all_forks(dual_scenarios: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:55):**
    *   **Purpose:** Applies `resolve_fork` to a list of scenario pairs.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```python
        list_of_scenario_pairs = [
            {
                "scenario_a": {"forecast": {"trace_id": "tA1", ...}},
                "scenario_b": {"forecast": {"trace_id": "tB1", ...}}
            },
            {
                "scenario_a": {"forecast": {"trace_id": "tA2", ...}},
                "scenario_b": {"forecast": {"trace_id": "tB2", ...}}
            }
        ]
        all_decisions = resolve_all_forks(list_of_scenario_pairs)
        # all_decisions will be a list of decision summary dicts.
        ```

*   **[`export_fork_decision_summary(results: List[Dict], path: str)`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:65):**
    *   **Purpose:** Saves the list of decision summaries to a JSON file.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```python
        # Assuming 'all_decisions' from previous example
        export_fork_decision_summary(all_decisions, "fork_decisions.json")
        # This will create 'fork_decisions.json' with the results.
        ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Scenario Keys:** The keys `"scenario_a"` and `"scenario_b"` are hardcoded in [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:37-38). If the input data structure changes these keys, the module will fail or produce incorrect results. Similarly, `"forecast"` is a hardcoded key.
*   **Decision Labels:** The decision labels `"A"` and `"B"` are hardcoded. This is tied to the scenario keys.
*   **Output Reason String:** The format of the `"reason"` string in the output of [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:49) is hardcoded.
*   **Default Empty Dict:** `pair.get("scenario_a", {}).get("forecast")` uses `{}` as a default. While this prevents immediate `KeyError`s, it relies on the subsequent `if not a or not b:` check to handle missing data.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **[`forecast_prioritization_engine.score_forecast`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0):** The core logic of *how* a scenario is scored is entirely delegated to this external function. Any changes to the scoring mechanism or data requirements of [`score_forecast()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0) will directly impact this module. This is a significant coupling point.
*   **[`forecast_cluster_classifier.classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:0):** The classification of the chosen forecast is delegated. Changes to this classifier's logic or data needs will affect the output.
*   **Input Data Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected dictionary structure for scenario pairs and forecasts (e.g., presence of `trace_id`, and fields required by the imported scoring and classification functions).
*   **Output Data Structure of `resolve_fork`:** Downstream consumers will be coupled to the keys and structure of the dictionary returned by [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30) (e.g., `decision`, `selected_trace_id`, `reason`, `cluster`, `score`).

## 8. Existing Tests

*   Based on the file listing for the `tests/` directory, there does **not** appear to be a dedicated test file for this module (e.g., `test_strategic_fork_resolver.py`).
*   This indicates a gap in unit testing for this specific module's logic (e.g., testing the decision logic under various score conditions, handling of missing data).
*   It's possible that some integration tests might cover its functionality indirectly, but specific unit tests are absent.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Input:** The primary entry point for batch processing is [`resolve_all_forks()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:55), which takes a list of `dual_scenarios`.
2.  **Iteration:** [`resolve_all_forks()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:55) iterates through each `pair` in `dual_scenarios` and calls [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30) for each.
3.  **Individual Fork Resolution (`resolve_fork`)**:
    a.  Extracts forecast data for 'scenario_a' and 'scenario_b'.
    b.  Handles missing data by returning an "undecided" result.
    c.  Calls [`score_fork_options()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:18) to get scores for A and B.
        i.  [`score_fork_options()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:18) internally calls [`score_forecast()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py:0) (from another module) for each scenario's forecast.
    d.  Compares scores: `decision = "A" if scores["A"] > scores["B"] else "B"`. (Note: Ties go to "B").
    e.  Constructs a result dictionary including the decision, selected trace ID, reason (scores), cluster classification (via [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:0)), and the raw scores.
4.  **Aggregation:** [`resolve_all_forks()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:55) collects the results from each [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30) call into a list.
5.  **Output (Optional):** The [`export_fork_decision_summary()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:65) function can be called with the list of results to save them as a JSON file.

The flow is straightforward: score each option in a pair, pick the higher score, and repeat for all pairs.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Names like [`score_fork_options()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:18), [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30), [`resolve_all_forks()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:55), and [`export_fork_decision_summary()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:65) are clear, follow PEP 8 (snake_case), and accurately describe their purpose.
*   **Variables:**
    *   `a`, `b`: Used for scenario A and scenario B forecasts. While short, their meaning is clear within the context of functions like [`score_fork_options()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:18) and [`resolve_fork()`](forecast_output/strategic_fork_resolver.py:30).
    *   `sa`, `sb`: Scores for a and b, clear abbreviations.
    *   `pair`, `dual_scenarios`: Descriptive.
    *   `scores`, `decision`, `reason`, `cluster`: Clear and descriptive for dictionary keys in the output.
*   **Module Name:** `strategic_fork_resolver.py` is descriptive.
*   **Docstrings:** Generally good, explaining the purpose of functions and the module. The module docstring mentions "Author: Pulse AI Engine" and "Version: v1.0.0", which seems like an AI-generated convention.
*   **Consistency:** Naming is consistent within the module.
*   **Potential AI Assumption Errors:** The "Author: Pulse AI Engine" might be an AI placeholder or a project convention. No other obvious AI assumption errors in naming are apparent. The code is quite straightforward.

Overall, naming conventions are good and adhere to Python standards.
