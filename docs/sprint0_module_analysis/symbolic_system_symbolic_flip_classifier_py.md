# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:) module is to analyze sequences of forecast "chains" (presumably representing evolving states or predictions) to identify and classify transitions in symbolic "arcs" and "tags". It aims to detect common patterns of change, identify cyclical or looping behaviors (e.g., a state flipping back and forth), and highlight patterns that might be resistant to automated repair, thus requiring operator review.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope. It contains three core functions:
- [`extract_transitions(chain)`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:19): Extracts individual arc and tag transitions from a single forecast chain.
- [`analyze_flip_patterns(chains)`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41): Aggregates transitions from multiple chains and counts their occurrences.
- [`detect_loops_or_cycles(flips)`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:65): Identifies potential loops where a state transitions to another and then back again.

There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass` statements in empty functions) or "TODO" comments within the provided code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Repair-Resistant Pattern Identification:** The module's docstring mentions identifying "Repair-resistant patterns for operator review". While it detects common flips and loops, there isn't an explicit function or logic dedicated to classifying patterns as "repair-resistant". This might be an intended next step or a feature handled by a consuming module based on the outputs of this one.
*   **Advanced Loop Detection:** The current [`detect_loops_or_cycles`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:65) function only detects simple A → B → A loops. More complex cycles (e.g., A → B → C → A) are not explicitly handled.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** The analysis is purely based on the provided "arc_label" and "symbolic_tag". It doesn't seem to incorporate other contextual data from the forecast chain items, which might offer deeper insights into why flips occur.
*   **Thresholds/Significance:** The module identifies top flips but doesn't have mechanisms to determine statistical significance or apply thresholds for what constitutes a "common" or "problematic" pattern. This logic might reside elsewhere or be a potential enhancement.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:** None are evident in the provided code. It's a self-contained utility module.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `typing` (specifically `List`, `Dict`): For type hinting.
    *   `collections` (specifically `Counter`): Used in [`analyze_flip_patterns`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41) for efficiently counting transition occurrences.
*   **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    *   The module expects input data in a specific format: a list of "chains", where each chain is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary within a chain is expected to potentially contain `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"` keys. This structure implies interaction with modules that generate or manage these forecast chains.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** The module processes in-memory Python data structures (lists of lists of dictionaries). It does not directly read from or write to files.
    *   **Output:** Functions return dictionaries and lists containing the analysis results (transition counts, identified loops). These outputs are presumably consumed by other parts of the system. No logging to files is apparent.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

**`extract_transitions(chain: List[Dict]) -> List[tuple]`**
*   **Purpose:** Takes a single forecast chain (list of dictionaries) and identifies points where `arc_label` or `symbolic_tag` changes between consecutive items.
*   **Example Usage (Conceptual):**
    ```python
    chain_example = [
        {"arc_label": "Hope", "symbolic_tag": "Positive"},
        {"arc_label": "Hope", "symbolic_tag": "Neutral"}, # Tag flip
        {"arc_label": "Fatigue", "symbolic_tag": "Neutral"} # Arc flip
    ]
    transitions = extract_transitions(chain_example)
    # Expected transitions:
    # [("TAG: Positive", "TAG: Neutral"), ("ARC: Hope", "ARC: Fatigue")]
    ```

**`analyze_flip_patterns(chains: List[List[Dict]]) -> Dict`**
*   **Purpose:** Processes multiple forecast chains, extracts all transitions using [`extract_transitions`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:19), and then counts the frequency of each unique transition.
*   **Example Usage (Conceptual):**
    ```python
    chain1 = [{"arc_label": "A", "symbolic_tag": "X"}, {"arc_label": "B", "symbolic_tag": "X"}]
    chain2 = [{"arc_label": "A", "symbolic_tag": "X"}, {"arc_label": "B", "symbolic_tag": "X"}]
    chain3 = [{"arc_label": "B", "symbolic_tag": "X"}, {"arc_label": "A", "symbolic_tag": "Y"}]
    all_chains = [chain1, chain2, chain3]
    analysis = analyze_flip_patterns(all_chains)
    # analysis might look like:
    # {
    #     "total_flips": 4, # (A->B)x2, (B->A), (X->Y)
    #     "unique_flips": 3,
    #     "top_flips": [(("ARC: A", "ARC: B"), 2), (("ARC: B", "ARC: A"), 1), (("TAG: X", "TAG: Y"), 1)],
    #     "all_flips": {("ARC: A", "ARC: B"): 2, ("ARC: B", "ARC: A"): 1, ("TAG: X", "TAG: Y"): 1}
    # }
    ```

**`detect_loops_or_cycles(flips: Dict[tuple, int]) -> List[str]`**
*   **Purpose:** Takes a dictionary of flip counts (like the `"all_flips"` output from [`analyze_flip_patterns`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41)) and identifies pairs of transitions that indicate a direct loop (e.g., A → B and B → A).
*   **Example Usage (Conceptual):**
    ```python
    flip_counts = {
        ("ARC: Hope", "ARC: Despair"): 5,
        ("ARC: Despair", "ARC: Hope"): 4,
        ("TAG: Up", "TAG: Down"): 10
    }
    loops = detect_loops_or_cycles(flip_counts)
    # Expected loops:
    # ["ARC: Hope ↔ ARC: Despair"]
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Labels:** The strings `"unknown"` are used as default values in [`extract_transitions`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:19) if `"arc_label"` or `"symbolic_tag"` are missing (lines [28](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:28), [29](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:29), [30](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:30), [31](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:31)). While this handles missing keys gracefully, "unknown" is a magic string. It might be better if this default was configurable or a more specific `None` or custom sentinel value was used, depending on downstream processing.
*   **Prefixes in Transitions:** The strings `"ARC: "` (line [34](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:34)) and `"TAG: "` (line [36](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:36)) are hardcoded as prefixes for the transition elements. If the naming convention for these symbolic types changes, or if new types are introduced, this code would need modification.
*   **Top N Flips:** In [`analyze_flip_patterns`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41), the number of top flips to return is hardcoded to `10` (line [60](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:60)). This could be parameterized.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Input Data Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected structure of the input `chains`: `List[List[Dict]]`, where inner dictionaries must contain keys like `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"`. Changes to this data structure in other parts of the system would break this module.
*   **Output Data Structure:** Consumers of this module will depend on the structure of the dictionaries and lists returned by its functions (e.g., the keys in the dictionary from [`analyze_flip_patterns`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41)).

## 8. Existing Tests

*   As per the `list_files` check on `tests/symbolic_system/`, a specific test file (e.g., `test_symbolic_flip_classifier.py`) does not appear to exist in that immediate directory.
*   There might be integration tests elsewhere that cover this module's functionality, but dedicated unit tests are not immediately apparent.
*   **Gaps:** Without dedicated unit tests, it's harder to ensure the correctness of each function, especially for edge cases (e.g., empty chains, chains with no flips, chains with all items having missing labels/tags).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a simple functional programming paradigm.
1.  **Input:** A list of "chains", where each chain is a time-ordered sequence of states (dictionaries).
2.  **Transition Extraction ([`extract_transitions`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:19)):** For each chain, iterate through consecutive states. If an "arc_label" or "symbolic_tag" changes, record this transition as a tuple (e.g., `("ARC: old_val", "ARC: new_val")`).
3.  **Pattern Analysis ([`analyze_flip_patterns`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41)):**
    *   Collect all transitions from all chains.
    *   Use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each unique transition.
    *   Sort these transitions by frequency to identify the most common ones.
    *   Return a dictionary containing total flips, unique flips, top N flips, and all flip counts.
4.  **Loop Detection ([`detect_loops_or_cycles`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:65)):**
    *   Take the dictionary of all flip counts.
    *   For each transition (A → B), check if the reverse transition (B → A) also exists in the counts.
    *   If both exist, it's identified as a loop candidate.
    *   Return a list of unique loop patterns.

The data flows from raw chain data, through transition extraction, to aggregated statistics, and finally to loop detection.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** [`extract_transitions`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:19), [`analyze_flip_patterns`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:41), [`detect_loops_or_cycles`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:65) are clear, verb-noun phrases, adhering to PEP 8.
*   **Variables:**
    *   `chain`, `chains`, `flips`, `all_flips`, `counter`, `sorted_flips`, `loop_candidates` are generally descriptive.
    *   `arc_prev`, `arc_curr`, `tag_prev`, `tag_curr` are clear.
    *   `a`, `b` in the lambda function (line [55](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:55)) and in the loop in [`detect_loops_or_cycles`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:65) (line [73](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:73)) are common for tuples but could be more descriptive if the tuple structure was more complex (though here it's simple `(from_state, to_state)`).
*   **Consistency:** Naming seems consistent within the module.
*   **AI Assumption Errors/Deviations:**
    *   The module name "Flip Classifier" is interesting. While it "classifies" by counting and identifying loops, the term "flip" seems to be domain-specific jargon for a transition.
    *   The input keys `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"` are assumed. If these are standard across the project, it's fine. If not, this module relies on those specific names.
    *   The author is listed as "Pulse AI Engine", which is a common placeholder.

Overall, naming conventions are good and follow Python standards.
