# Module Analysis: `pipeline/model_manager.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:9) class within [`pipeline/model_manager.py`](pipeline/model_manager.py:) is to handle interactions with a model registry (e.g., MLflow, DVC) and manage model training or fine-tuning jobs. It is intended to encapsulate the logic for connecting to a registry, initiating training processes, and logging model metrics.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module is a **skeleton implementation** and is largely incomplete.
- The [`__init__`](pipeline/model_manager.py:10) method initializes `self.registry_uri` but contains a `TODO` comment indicating that the client/connection setup to the model registry is not yet implemented ([`pipeline/model_manager.py:15`](pipeline/model_manager.py:15)).
- The [`train`](pipeline/model_manager.py:17) method has a `TODO` for implementing the actual training or fine-tuning logic ([`pipeline/model_manager.py:23`](pipeline/model_manager.py:23)) and currently returns placeholder model information.
- The [`log_metrics`](pipeline/model_manager.py:31) method has a `TODO` for implementing metrics logging ([`pipeline/model_manager.py:35`](pipeline/model_manager.py:35)) and currently has a `pass` statement.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Registry Connection:** The core functionality of connecting to and interacting with a model registry (e.g., MLflow, DVC) is missing. The `TODO` on [`pipeline/model_manager.py:15`](pipeline/model_manager.py:15) highlights this.
- **Training Logic:** The actual model training or fine-tuning process is not implemented, as noted by the `TODO` on [`pipeline/model_manager.py:23`](pipeline/model_manager.py:23). This would involve loading data, selecting/configuring a model, running the training loop, and saving the model artifacts.
- **Metrics Logging:** The mechanism to log evaluation metrics to the model registry is absent, indicated by the `TODO` on [`pipeline/model_manager.py:35`](pipeline/model_manager.py:35).
- **Model Versioning/Retrieval:** While the `train` method returns a placeholder for `model_uri` and `version`, there's no explicit logic for versioning new models or retrieving existing models from the registry.
- **Error Handling:** No error handling is present for potential issues like registry connection failures, training errors, or data loading problems.
- **Configuration:** The module doesn't seem to handle any configuration for training parameters, model types, or registry specifics beyond the URI.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from Other Project Modules
- None are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.

### External Library Dependencies
- `typing.Dict` is imported.
- Implicitly, it would depend on a model registry library (like `mlflow` or `dvc`) once the `TODO` sections are implemented.
- It would also likely depend on machine learning framework libraries (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`) for the actual training logic.

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data
- **Input:** The [`train`](pipeline/model_manager.py:17) method expects a `feature_path: str`, implying it reads feature data from a file system path. This data would likely be produced by a preceding module in a pipeline (e.g., a feature engineering module).
- **Output:** The [`train`](pipeline/model_manager.py:17) method is intended to produce a trained model, which would be stored in the model registry and potentially on the file system. Its metadata (`model_uri`, `version`) would be passed to other modules or logged.

### Input/Output Files
- **Input:** Feature dataset file (path provided to the [`train`](pipeline/model_manager.py:17) method).
- **Output:**
    - Model artifacts (stored in the registry/file system).
    - Potentially logs related to training progress and metrics.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

```python
# Hypothetical usage once implemented:
from pipeline.model_manager import ModelManager

# Initialize with the model registry URI
model_registry_service_uri = "mlflow://localhost:5000" # Or DVC remote, etc.
manager = ModelManager(registry_uri=model_registry_service_uri)

# Path to the feature data
path_to_features = "data/processed/features.csv"

# Train a model
# This would trigger the (currently unimplemented) training logic
model_metadata = manager.train(feature_path=path_to_features)
print(f"Model trained: {model_metadata['model_uri']}, Version: {model_metadata['version']}")

# Log some evaluation metrics (assuming they were calculated elsewhere)
evaluation_metrics = {"accuracy": 0.85, "f1_score": 0.82}
manager.log_metrics(model_info=model_metadata, metrics=evaluation_metrics)
print(f"Metrics logged for model version: {model_metadata['version']}")
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- The placeholder values in the `model_info` dictionary within the [`train`](pipeline/model_manager.py:17) method ([`pipeline/model_manager.py:24-28`](pipeline/model_manager.py:24-28)) are hardcoded empty strings.
  ```python
  model_info = {
      "model_uri": "",  # Hardcoded empty string
      "version": "",    # Hardcoded empty string
      "metrics": {}
  }
  ```
- No other explicit hardcoded paths, secrets, or magic numbers are visible in the current skeleton, but they could be introduced when the `TODO` sections are filled.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **Model Registry:** Tightly coupled to the specific model registry service (e.g., MLflow, DVC) that will be implemented. The choice of registry will dictate the client library and API calls.
- **Feature Data Format:** Implicitly coupled to the format and schema of the feature data located at `feature_path`.
- **Training Orchestration:** This module would likely be called by an orchestrator module (e.g., [`pipeline/orchestrator.py`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:)) that manages the overall ML pipeline flow.
- **Evaluation Module:** Metrics logged via [`log_metrics`](pipeline/model_manager.py:31) would likely be generated by a separate evaluation module.

## 8. Existing Tests

- Based on the `list_files` result for `tests/pipeline` (No files found), there are **no existing tests** for this module or any other module within the `pipeline` directory.
- A test file like `tests/pipeline/test_model_manager.py` would be expected.
- Test coverage is 0%.
- Obvious Gaps:
    - Tests for registry connection (mocking the registry).
    - Tests for the training process (mocking data loading and model training calls).
    - Tests for metrics logging.
    - Tests for handling various `feature_path` inputs.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

- **Architecture:** The module is designed around a single class, [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:9).
- **Key Components:**
    - `__init__`: Initializes the connection to the model registry.
    - `train`: Orchestrates the model training/fine-tuning process using features from a given path and registers the model.
    - `log_metrics`: Logs evaluation metrics for a given model to the registry.
- **Primary Data/Control Flows:**
    1.  **Initialization:** An instance of `ModelManager` is created with a `registry_uri`.
    2.  **Training Request:** The `train` method is called with a `feature_path`.
        *   (Intended) It would load data, train a model, version it, and store it in the registry.
        *   (Current) Returns placeholder info.
    3.  **Metrics Logging:** The `log_metrics` method is called with model information and metrics.
        *   (Intended) It would log these metrics to the specified model in the registry.
        *   (Current) Does nothing.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Class Name:** `ModelManager` follows PascalCase, which is standard for Python classes (PEP 8).
- **Method Names:** `__init__`, `train`, `log_metrics` use snake_case, which is standard for Python functions and methods (PEP 8).
- **Variable Names:**
    - `registry_uri`, `feature_path`, `model_info`, `metrics` use snake_case, which is appropriate.
- **Type Hinting:** `Dict` is used from the `typing` module.
- **Docstrings:** Present for the module, class, and methods, providing a basic description. The `train` method's docstring includes a `Returns:` section.

Overall, the naming conventions appear consistent and follow PEP 8 guidelines. No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations are noted in the existing skeleton code.
