# Analysis Report: `iris/check_env_vars.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`iris/check_env_vars.py`](iris/check_env_vars.py:1) module is to verify that all required environment variables, specifically API keys and credentials for various Pulse plugins, are set in the system's environment. It serves as a diagnostic tool to ensure the application has the necessary configurations to interact with external services.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be **complete** for its defined purpose. It successfully checks for a predefined list of environment variables and reports their status. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments within the provided code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Extensibility:** The module currently hardcodes the list of required environment variables within the [`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8) function. It was likely intended to be a simple script. For a more extensive or evolving system, this list might be better managed through a configuration file or a more dynamic discovery mechanism, perhaps integrated with the plugin system itself.
*   **Logical Next Steps:**
    *   The script could be enhanced to not just check but also guide the user on how or where to set these variables if they are missing.
    *   It could potentially integrate with a configuration management system if one exists or is planned for the project.
*   **Deviation/Stoppage:** There are no clear indications that development started on a more complex path and then stopped short. The module is straightforward and fulfills its stated purpose.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html): Used to access environment variables via [`os.getenv()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:26).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:** The module reads environment variables, which are a form of shared data accessible by other modules in the Pulse system that rely on these API keys.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** Reads environment variables from the system.
    *   **Output:** Prints status messages to the standard output (console). It does not write to any log files or data files.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains a single primary function:

*   **[`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8):**
    *   **Purpose:** Iterates through a predefined dictionary of required environment variable names and their descriptions. For each variable, it checks if it's set in the environment. It then prints the status of each variable (SET or NOT SET) and a masked value for set variables to avoid exposing full secrets. Finally, it provides a summary indicating if all required variables are set.
    *   **Usage:** The module is designed to be run as a script.
        ```bash
        python iris/check_env_vars.py
        ```
        This will execute the [`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8) function and print the report to the console.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Environment Variable List:** The dictionary [`required_vars`](iris/check_env_vars.py:10) within the [`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8) function is hardcoded. This includes:
    *   `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY`
    *   `FRED_API_KEY`
    *   `FINNHUB_API_KEY`
    *   `NASDAQ_API_KEY`
    *   `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
    *   `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
    *   `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`
    *   `NEWS_API_KEY`
    *   `GITHUB_TOKEN`
*   **Masking Suffix Length:** The value `4` in [`value[-4:]`](iris/check_env_vars.py:27) for masking is hardcoded. While common, it might not be suitable for all key formats.
*   **Print Messages:** All status messages and headers (e.g., `"===== CHECKING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ====="`](iris/check_env_vars.py:22), `"✓ SET"`](iris/check_env_vars.py:28), `"✗ NOT SET"`](iris/check_env_vars.py:28)) are hardcoded strings.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Environment Variables:** The module is tightly coupled to the specific set of environment variables defined in [`required_vars`](iris/check_env_vars.py:10). Any change in required API keys for Pulse plugins would necessitate an update to this module's code.
*   **Plugin System (Implicit):** While not directly interacting with plugin code, the module's purpose is to support the plugin system by ensuring its dependencies (API keys) are met.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   Based on the provided file listings for `tests/` and `iris/`, there is **no dedicated test file** specifically for [`iris/check_env_vars.py`](iris/check_env_vars.py:1) (e.g., `tests/test_check_env_vars.py` or `iris/test_check_env_vars.py`).
*   The module is simple and primarily performs I/O (reading environment variables and printing to console), which can be less straightforward to unit test without mocking `os.getenv` and capturing stdout.
*   Given its nature as a standalone diagnostic script, formal unit tests might have been deemed lower priority. However, tests could be written to verify:
    *   Correct identification of set/unset variables.
    *   Proper masking of secret values.
    *   Correct summary messages.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Initialization:** The script defines a dictionary [`required_vars`](iris/check_env_vars.py:10) mapping environment variable names to their descriptions.
2.  **Execution Trigger:** If run as the main script (`if __name__ == "__main__":`), it calls the [`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8) function.
3.  **Environment Check Loop:**
    *   The [`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8) function prints a header.
    *   It iterates through each item in [`required_vars`](iris/check_env_vars.py:10).
    *   For each variable, it uses [`os.getenv()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:26) to retrieve its value.
    *   It determines the status ("SET" or "NOT SET").
    *   If set and long enough, it creates a masked version of the value.
    *   It prints the variable name, status, and masked value (if applicable).
    *   It keeps track if all variables are set using the `all_set` boolean.
4.  **Summary:** After checking all variables, it prints a summary message indicating whether all required variables were found.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Module Name:** [`check_env_vars.py`](iris/check_env_vars.py:1) is clear and follows Python conventions (snake_case).
*   **Function Name:** [`check_env_vars()`](iris/check_env_vars.py:8) is clear, descriptive, and follows snake_case.
*   **Variable Names:**
    *   [`required_vars`](iris/check_env_vars.py:10): Clear and descriptive.
    *   [`var`, `description`](iris/check_env_vars.py:25): Standard for loop variables.
    *   [`value`](iris/check_env_vars.py:26): Generic but clear in context.
    *   [`masked_value`](iris/check_env_vars.py:27): Clear and descriptive.
    *   [`status`](iris/check_env_vars.py:28): Clear.
    *   [`all_set`](iris/check_env_vars.py:24): Clear.
*   **Constants (Environment Variable Keys):** The keys in the [`required_vars`](iris/check_env_vars.py:10) dictionary (e.g., `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY`) are in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is appropriate for constants representing environment variable names.
*   **Overall:** Naming conventions are consistent and adhere well to PEP 8 guidelines. No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations are noted.
