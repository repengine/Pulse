# Module Analysis: `simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`build_timeline.py`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py) module is to consolidate multiple individual JSON snapshot files from a specified directory into a single, ordered JSON timeline file. It acts as a utility script to aggregate time-series data.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be a complete and functional utility for its defined purpose. It takes an input directory and an output file path as command-line arguments, reads all JSON files, sorts them by filename (implicitly assuming filenames correspond to chronological order), and writes them as a list into a new JSON file. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Lack of Sophisticated Sorting:** The module sorts files based on their names ([`files.sort()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:12)). This is a simple approach and might not be robust if filenames don't naturally sort chronologically (e.g., if timestamps are not zero-padded or if a different naming convention is used). A more robust implementation might involve extracting a timestamp from the file content or metadata.
*   **No Error Handling for File Content:** The script assumes all `.json` files in the input directory are valid JSON and contain data that can be appended to a list. It doesn't include error handling for malformed JSON files or files with unexpected structures.
*   **No Configuration for File Matching:** It strictly looks for files ending with `.json` ([`f.endswith('.json')`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:11)). There's no option to customize this pattern.
*   **No Logging:** The script does not include any logging, which would be beneficial for tracking its operation, especially with a large number of files.

Logical next steps could include:
*   Implementing more robust sorting based on timestamps within the JSON files.
*   Adding error handling for file reading and JSON parsing.
*   Introducing basic logging.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None. This is a standalone utility script.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`argparse`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:1): For parsing command-line arguments.
    *   [`json`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:2): For reading and writing JSON files.
    *   [`os`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:3): For interacting with the file system (listing directory contents, joining paths).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   **Input:** Reads multiple `.json` files from a user-specified directory (`--input-dir`). These files are presumably generated by other parts of the simulation engine, representing individual snapshots in time.
    *   **Output:** Writes a single `.json` file to a user-specified path (`--output-path`), containing an array of all the input snapshots. This combined timeline file could then be consumed by other analysis or visualization tools.
*   **Input/output files:**
    *   **Input:** Multiple JSON files (e.g., `snapshot_001.json`, `snapshot_002.json`, etc.) located in the directory specified by `--input-dir`.
    *   **Output:** A single JSON file (e.g., `combined_timeline.json`) specified by `--output-path`.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains a single primary function, [`main()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:5).

**Usage (Command-Line):**

```bash
python simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py --input-dir /path/to/snapshots --output-path /path/to/combined_timeline.json
```

*   `--input-dir`: Specifies the directory containing the individual JSON snapshot files.
*   `--output-path`: Specifies the file path where the combined JSON timeline will be saved.

The script will then:
1.  List all files ending with `.json` in the `input-dir`.
2.  Sort these files alphabetically.
3.  Read each JSON file, parse its content.
4.  Append the content of each file as an element to a list.
5.  Write this list to the `output-path` as a JSON array.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **File Extension:** The file extension `.json` is hardcoded ([`f.endswith('.json')`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:11)) for identifying input files. While common, making this configurable could add flexibility.
*   There are no other obvious hardcoded paths, secrets, or magic numbers/strings critical to its core logic beyond the file extension.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **File System:** Tightly coupled to the file system for reading input files from a directory and writing the output file.
*   **JSON Format:** Assumes input files are valid JSON and that the desired output is a JSON array of these inputs.
*   **Filename Sorting Convention:** Implicitly relies on the alphabetical sorting of filenames to achieve chronological order of snapshots. This is a weak coupling point but important for the correctness of the timeline.

## 8. Existing Tests

No specific test file (e.g., `tests/simulation_engine/utils/test_build_timeline.py`) was found during the analysis. This indicates a lack of dedicated unit tests for this module.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Argument Parsing:** The [`main()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:5) function initializes an [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:6) to accept `--input-dir` and `--output-path`.
2.  **File Discovery:** It uses [`os.listdir()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:11) to get all entries in the input directory and filters for files ending with `.json`.
3.  **File Sorting:** The list of JSON files is sorted alphabetically using [`files.sort()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:12).
4.  **Data Aggregation:** It iterates through the sorted file list:
    a.  Constructs the full path to each file using [`os.path.join()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:15).
    b.  Opens and reads each file using `with open(...)` and [`json.load()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:17) to parse the JSON content.
    c.  Appends the parsed snapshot to the `timeline` list ([`timeline.append(snapshot)`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:18)).
5.  **Output Generation:** After processing all files, it opens the specified `output-path` in write mode and uses [`json.dump()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:21) to write the `timeline` list to the output file, formatted with an indent of 2 for readability.
6.  **Execution Guard:** The script uses the common `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard ([`if __name__ == "__main__":`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:23)) to ensure [`main()`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:5) is called only when the script is executed directly.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** [`main`](../../simulation_engine/utils/build_timeline.py:5) follows Python's lowercase with underscores convention (snake_case).
*   **Variables:** Variables like `parser`, `args`, `files`, `timeline`, `filename`, `file_path`, `snapshot`, `out_f` generally follow snake_case or are short and conventional (e.g., `f` for file handle).
*   **Command-line Arguments:** `--input-dir` and `--output-path` use kebab-case, which is standard for command-line arguments.
*   The naming is generally clear and consistent with common Python practices (PEP 8). No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations were noted.
