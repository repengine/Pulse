# Module Analysis: `forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`symbolic_tuning_engine.py`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:1) module is to revise forecasts that have been flagged for changes. It applies symbolic tuning suggestions, which can include modifications to overlay suggestions, arc/tag replacements, and alignment optimization. The module then outputs these revised forecasts along with a score and a summary of the changes made.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely functional for its defined scope.
- It has core logic for applying revisions, rescoring, comparing, and logging.
- It includes type hinting and basic logging.
- There are no explicit "TODO" comments or obvious placeholders for core functionality within the existing functions.
- A basic inline test function [`_test_symbolic_tuning_engine()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:122) exists, suggesting an initial level of completion.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Limited Revision Scope:** The current [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24) function only handles `"arc_label"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, and `"overlay_"` prefixed keys in the `plan`. The module description mentions "Alignment optimization" as a basis for revision, but there's no clear mechanism or function call within this module that actively performs or applies alignment *optimization* strategies beyond recalculating the score after other revisions. It seems to rely on external inputs for the revision `plan`.
- **Error Handling in Overlay Parsing:** The [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24) function has a `try-except` block for parsing overlay values ([`forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:46-49`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:46-49)). While it logs an error, it doesn't re-raise or handle it in a way that might halt processing or flag the revision as partially failed. The `float(str(v).split()[0])` logic seems a bit fragile and might benefit from more robust parsing or clearer input expectations for overlay values in the `plan`.
- **Configuration:** The log file path in [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97) is hardcoded. This should ideally be configurable.
- **Integration with Flagging Mechanism:** The module "Takes forecasts flagged for revision," but there's no code within this module showing how it receives these flagged forecasts or the revision plans. This suggests reliance on an external orchestrator or calling process.
- **Scoring Sophistication:** While it re-calculates `alignment_score` and `license_status`, the "scoring" of revised forecasts mentioned in the module docstring ([`forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:11`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:11)) seems limited to these existing metrics. More sophisticated scoring or evaluation specific to the *impact* of the tuning might be an implied next step.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from other project modules:
- [`from trust_system.alignment_index import compute_alignment_index`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:20)
- [`from trust_system.license_enforcer import license_forecast`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:21)

### External library dependencies:
- `json` (standard library)
- `logging` (standard library)
- `typing` (standard library, for `Dict`, `Optional`, `Any`)

### Interaction with other modules via shared data:
- **Input Forecasts & Revision Plans:** The module expects forecast objects (dictionaries) and revision plan objects (dictionaries) as inputs to its main functions. The origin of these data structures is external to this module.
- **Output Revised Forecasts:** The module produces revised forecast dictionaries.

### Input/output files:
- **Output Log File:** The [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97) function appends JSON line records to a log file, hardcoded as `"logs/tuning_results.jsonl"` ([`forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97)).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### [`apply_revision_plan(forecast: Dict[str, Any], plan: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, Any]`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24)
   - **Purpose:** Applies specific field updates from a `plan` to a `forecast` dictionary.
   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     original_forecast = {
         "arc_label": "Old Arc",
         "symbolic_tag": "Old Tag",
         "overlays": {"intensity": 0.5},
         "other_field": "value"
     }
     revision_plan = {
         "arc_label": "New Arc",
         "overlay_intensity": "0.8", # Note: string value for overlay
         "overlay_new_metric": "0.3"
     }
     revised_forecast = apply_revision_plan(original_forecast, revision_plan)
     # revised_forecast will be a deep copy with "arc_label" and overlays updated.
     # revised_forecast["revision_applied"] will be True.
     ```

### [`simulate_revised_forecast(forecast: Dict[str, Any], plan: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, Any]`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:55)
   - **Purpose:** Applies a revision plan, then re-computes alignment scores and license status for the revised forecast.
   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     # Assuming compute_alignment_index and license_forecast are available
     # and original_forecast, revision_plan are defined as above.
     fully_revised_forecast = simulate_revised_forecast(original_forecast, revision_plan)
     # fully_revised_forecast will have updated "arc_label", "overlays",
     # "alignment_score", "alignment_components", and "license_status".
     ```

### [`compare_scores(original: Dict[str, Any], revised: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:74)
   - **Purpose:** Calculates the difference in `alignment_score` and `confidence` between an original and a revised forecast.
   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     original_metrics = {"alignment_score": 0.5, "confidence": 0.7, "license_status": "Approved"}
     revised_metrics = {"alignment_score": 0.8, "confidence": 0.6, "license_status": "Revised"}
     deltas = compare_scores(original_metrics, revised_metrics)
     # deltas will be:
     # {
     #   "alignment_score": 0.3,
     #   "confidence": -0.1,
     #   "license_status_change": "Approved â†’ Revised"
     # }
     ```

### [`log_tuning_result(original: Dict[str, Any], revised: Dict[str, Any], path: str = "logs/tuning_results.jsonl")`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97)
   - **Purpose:** Logs a summary of the original and revised forecast details to a JSONL file.
   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     # Assuming original_forecast and revised_forecast are populated dicts
     log_tuning_result(original_forecast, revised_forecast)
     # A new line will be appended to "logs/tuning_results.jsonl"
     ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Log File Path:** The output path `"logs/tuning_results.jsonl"` in [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97) is hardcoded. This should be configurable, perhaps via a global configuration object or passed as a parameter.
- **Overlay Key Prefix:** The prefix `"overlay_"` used to identify overlay-related keys in the `plan` within [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:44) is hardcoded.
- **Score Comparison Fields:** The list of fields `["alignment_score", "confidence"]` in [`compare_scores()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:85) is hardcoded. If other scores become relevant, this list would need manual updates.
- **Default Trace ID Suffix:** The `"_rev"` suffix added to `revised_trace_id` in [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:108) is hardcoded.
- **Default Values for Missing Keys:** In [`compare_scores()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:89-90) and [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:107-112), default values like `0` or `"unknown"` are used if keys are missing. While this prevents `KeyError`s, it might obscure issues if certain keys are unexpectedly absent.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **`trust_system.alignment_index.compute_alignment_index`:** Tightly coupled for recalculating alignment scores. Changes in the `compute_alignment_index` API or its expected input/output format would directly impact this module.
- **`trust_system.license_enforcer.license_forecast`:** Tightly coupled for re-evaluating license status. Changes in `license_forecast` API or logic would affect this module.
- **Forecast Data Structure:** The module heavily relies on a specific dictionary structure for forecasts (e.g., expecting keys like `"arc_label"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, `"overlays"`, `"alignment_score"`, `"trace_id"`, `"license_status"`). Any changes to this structure in other parts of the system would require updates here.
- **Revision Plan Structure:** Similarly, it expects a specific dictionary structure for the `plan` argument.
- **Logging Subsystem:** While it uses the standard `logging` module, the error logging in [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:49) is basic. A more structured logging approach across the project might be desirable. The [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97) function also prints to `stdout` which might not be ideal for a library module.

## 8. Existing Tests

- **Inline Test Function:** There is a basic inline test function [`_test_symbolic_tuning_engine()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:122) within the module itself. This test covers the [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24) function for `arc_label`, `symbolic_tag`, and `overlays` updates.
- **No Dedicated Test File:** A `list_files` check on `tests/forecast_output/` revealed no dedicated test files (e.g., `test_symbolic_tuning_engine.py`) for this module in that conventional location.
- **Coverage Gaps:**
    - The inline test does not cover [`simulate_revised_forecast()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:55), [`compare_scores()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:74), or [`log_tuning_result()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97).
    - It doesn't test edge cases for [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24), such as empty plans, plans with unexpected keys, or malformed overlay values (though the code has a `try-except` for the latter, its behavior isn't tested).
    - The interactions with `compute_alignment_index` and `license_forecast` are not tested, likely requiring mocking in a more formal test setup.
- **Nature of Test:** The existing test is a simple assertion-based check for happy-path scenarios of one function.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Input:** The module primarily operates on a `forecast` dictionary and a `plan` dictionary detailing the revisions.
2.  **[`apply_revision_plan(forecast, plan)`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24):**
    *   Creates a deep copy of the input `forecast`.
    *   Iterates through the `plan`:
        *   Updates `arc_label` if present in `plan`.
        *   Updates `symbolic_tag` if present in `plan`.
        *   Updates `overlays` based on keys prefixed with `overlay_` in `plan`, attempting to parse the value as a float. Logs errors on parsing failure.
    *   Sets a `"revision_applied": True` flag in the revised forecast.
    *   Returns the revised forecast.
3.  **[`simulate_revised_forecast(forecast, plan)`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:55):**
    *   Calls [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24) to get the base revised forecast.
    *   Calls [`compute_alignment_index()`](trust_system/alignment_index.py) with the revised forecast.
    *   Updates the revised forecast with the new `alignment_score` and `alignment_components`.
    *   Calls [`license_forecast()`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py) with the revised forecast.
    *   Updates the revised forecast with the new `license_status`.
    *   Returns the fully updated revised forecast.
4.  **[`compare_scores(original, revised)`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:74):**
    *   Compares `alignment_score` and `confidence` between the original and revised forecasts.
    *   Records the change in `license_status`.
    *   Returns a dictionary of these deltas.
5.  **[`log_tuning_result(original, revised, path)`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:97):**
    *   Constructs a JSON record containing trace IDs, license statuses, alignment delta, and the revision plan.
    *   Appends this record to the specified log file (defaults to `"logs/tuning_results.jsonl"`).
    *   Prints a success or failure message to `stdout`.

The overall flow is sequential: apply revisions, rescore, optionally compare, and log results. The module is designed to be called by an external process that supplies the forecasts and revision plans.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** Generally follow PEP 8 (snake_case, e.g., [`apply_revision_plan`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:24), [`simulate_revised_forecast`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:55)). The internal test function [`_test_symbolic_tuning_engine`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:122) uses a leading underscore, which is appropriate for internal use/tests not meant to be part of the public API.
- **Variables:** Mostly snake_case (e.g., `revised`, `alignment_score`, `overlay_key`). Single letter variables `k`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `b` are used in short loops or comprehensions, which is acceptable.
- **Module Name:** `symbolic_tuning_engine.py` is descriptive.
- **Clarity:** Names are generally clear and indicate purpose (e.g., `plan`, `deltas`).
- **Consistency:**
    - The term "alignment" is used consistently.
    - "Revision" and "tuning" are used somewhat interchangeably, which is acceptable given the context.
- **Potential AI Assumption Errors/Deviations:**
    - The author is listed as "Pulse AI Engine" ([`forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:13`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:13)), which is likely a placeholder or an AI-generated attribution.
    - The version `v1.0.0` ([`forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:14`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:14)) seems standard.
    - The parsing of overlay values `float(str(v).split()[0])` in [`apply_revision_plan()`](forecast_output/symbolic_tuning_engine.py:47) might be an AI's attempt to handle potentially complex string inputs for numbers (e.g., "0.3 units") but is not very robust. It assumes the numeric part is always first and space-separated if other text exists. This could be an area where AI assumptions about input format led to a specific but potentially fragile implementation.

Overall, naming conventions are good and largely adhere to Python standards.
