# Module Analysis: `operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:1) module is to generate a Markdown summary report based on symbolic tuning results. This report details license changes, improvements in alignment scores, and the revision plans that were applied during the tuning process. It is designed to provide a human-readable overview of the outcomes of automated forecast revisions.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its stated purpose. It successfully loads tuning data from a JSON log file, processes this data to extract key metrics, and generates a structured Markdown report.

-   It includes a self-contained test function, [`_test_symbolic_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:73), which uses dummy data to generate a sample report, indicating a level of testing and operational readiness for its core functionality.
-   There are no explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders in the main operational code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **Input Data Source:** The module relies on an input file path ([`path: str`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:20) in [`load_tuning_results()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:20)) for the tuning results. The origin and expected location/naming convention of this file are not defined within the module, suggesting a dependency on an external process to generate and place this file correctly.
-   **Error Handling:** Error handling is basic, consisting of `print` statements to standard output (e.g., [`print(f"❌ Failed to load tuning results: {e}")`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:26)). For integration into a larger system, more robust logging (e.g., using the `logging` module) or custom exception handling might be beneficial.
-   **Configuration:** The default output filename and some report content (like specific status strings) are hardcoded. While the output filename can be overridden, a more extensive system might use a configuration file or settings module for such parameters.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

-   **Direct Project Module Imports:** None. This module is self-contained in terms of direct Python imports from other parts of the project.
-   **External Library Dependencies:**
    -   [`json`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:15): Used for parsing JSON objects from the input log file.
    -   [`collections.Counter`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:16): Used to count the frequency of symbolic revision plan operations.
    -   [`typing`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:17) (`List`, `Dict`, `Any`): Used for type hinting to improve code clarity and maintainability.
-   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    -   The module's primary interaction is through a file system: it reads a log file (format: one JSON object per line) presumably generated by the "Pulse Tuning Engine" or a similar component.
-   **Input/Output Files:**
    -   **Input:** A line-delimited JSON file containing tuning result entries. The structure of these JSON objects is implicitly defined by the keys accessed in the module (e.g., `original_trace_id`, `alignment_delta`, `original_license`, `revised_license`, `symbolic_revision_plan`).
    -   **Output:** A Markdown file (default name: [`symbolic_revision_report.md`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30)). The test function outputs [`test_symbolic_revision_report.md`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:90).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

-   **[`load_tuning_results(path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:20):**
    ```python
    # Assuming 'tuning_results.jsonl' contains lines of JSON objects:
    # {"original_trace_id": "fc1", "alignment_delta": 0.2, "original_license": "X", "revised_license": "Y"}
    # {"original_trace_id": "fc2", "alignment_delta": -0.1, "original_license": "X", "revised_license": "Y"}
    tuning_logs = load_tuning_results("tuning_results.jsonl")
    ```

-   **[`generate_revision_report(results: List[Dict[str, Any]], output_md: str = "symbolic_revision_report.md")`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30):**
    ```python
    sample_results = [
        {
            "original_trace_id": "trace_001",
            "alignment_delta": 0.15,
            "original_license": "❌ Rejected",
            "revised_license": "✅ Approved",
            "symbolic_revision_plan": {"strategy_A": "apply", "filter_B": "enable"}
        },
        {
            "original_trace_id": "trace_002",
            "alignment_delta": -0.05,
            "original_license": "❌ Rejected",
            "revised_license": "❌ Rejected",
            "symbolic_revision_plan": {"heuristic_C": "adjust"}
        }
    ]
    generate_revision_report(sample_results, output_md="custom_revision_summary.md")
    ```
    The internal [`_test_symbolic_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:73) function also serves as a practical usage example.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Default Filenames:** The default output filename is hardcoded as [`"symbolic_revision_report.md"`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30) in [`generate_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30) and [`"test_symbolic_revision_report.md"`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:90) in the test function. This is acceptable as a default that can be overridden.
-   **Report Content Strings:**
    -   Report titles and section headers (e.g., `"# 🧠 Symbolic Revision Report"`, `"## 📈 Improvement Summary"`) are hardcoded. This is standard for report generation scripts.
    -   License status strings [`"✅ Approved"`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:40) and [`"❌ Rejected"`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:78) are hardcoded for filtering and display. If these status indicators change system-wide, this module would require updates.
    -   The report footer [`"---Generated by Pulse Tuning Engine"`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:67) is hardcoded.
-   **Magic Numbers:**
    -   The number of common tuning operations displayed is hardcoded to `10` ([`plans.most_common(10)`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:58)).
    -   The number of sample delta entries displayed in the table is hardcoded to `10` ([`results[:10]`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:64)).

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **Input Data Schema:** The module is tightly coupled to the structure and key names of the JSON objects within the input log file. Expected keys include `alignment_delta`, `revised_license`, `original_license`, `original_trace_id`, and `symbolic_revision_plan`. Any changes to this schema in the upstream logging component would break this report generator.
-   **License Status Strings:** As noted in "Hardcoding Issues," the module relies on specific string values for license statuses (e.g., [`"✅ Approved"`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:40)). This creates a coupling point if these strings are defined or managed elsewhere.
-   **File-Based Data Exchange:** The reliance on a file (path provided as a string) for input data means it's coupled to the file system and the process that generates this file.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   An internal test function, [`_test_symbolic_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:73), is present.
-   This function prepares a small list of `dummy` tuning result dictionaries and calls [`generate_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30) to create a [`test_symbolic_revision_report.md`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:90).
-   The test is primarily functional; it checks if the report generation process runs without exceptions using sample data and prints a success message. It does not perform assertions on the content or structure of the generated Markdown file.
-   There is no apparent corresponding test file in a dedicated `tests/` directory (e.g., `tests/operator_interface/test_symbolic_revision_report.py`) based on the provided file listing.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Load Tuning Results:** The [`load_tuning_results()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:20) function is called with a file path. It opens the file, reads each line, strips whitespace, and attempts to parse it as a JSON object. Valid JSON objects are collected into a list of dictionaries. Errors during loading are printed to the console, and an empty list is returned.
2.  **Generate Report Data:** The [`generate_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30) function receives the list of tuning results.
    *   It filters these results to create sub-lists: `improved` (where `alignment_delta > 0`), `accepted` (where `revised_license == "✅ Approved"`), and `still_rejected`.
    *   It iterates through the results to populate a `collections.Counter` (`plans`) with the keys found in the nested `symbolic_revision_plan` dictionary, effectively counting the usage of different tuning operations.
3.  **Write Markdown Report:**
    *   The function opens the specified `output_md` file in write mode.
    *   It writes the main title: `"# 🧠 Symbolic Revision Report"`.
    *   It writes the total number of revised forecasts.
    *   It creates an "📈 Improvement Summary" section, listing counts of improved alignments, approved revisions, and still-rejected forecasts.
    *   It creates a "🔁 Most Common Symbolic Tuning Operations" section, listing the top 10 most common operations from the `plans` counter.
    *   It creates a "🔍 Sample Delta Table" section, writing a Markdown table header and then populating rows with data from the first 10 tuning results (original trace ID, alignment delta, and license change).
    *   A footer indicating generation by the "Pulse Tuning Engine" is added.
    *   Success or failure messages for report generation are printed to the console.
4.  **Script Execution:** If the file is run directly (i.e., `if __name__ == "__main__":`), the [`_test_symbolic_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:73) function is executed, which uses dummy data to test the report generation.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Module Name:** [`symbolic_revision_report.py`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:1) is descriptive and follows Python conventions (snake_case).
-   **Function Names:** [`load_tuning_results()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:20), [`generate_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:30), [`_test_symbolic_revision_report()`](operator_interface/symbolic_revision_report.py:73). These are clear, use snake_case, and adhere to PEP 8. The leading underscore in `_test_symbolic_revision_report` appropriately suggests it's an internal/test utility.
-   **Variable Names:** Generally use snake_case (e.g., `output_md`, `alignment_delta`, `original_trace_id`, `still_rejected`).
-   **Constants/Literals:** String literals like `"✅ Approved"` are used directly. While not strictly constants (as they are not ALL_CAPS), their usage is localized.
-   **Comments & Docstrings:** The module has a top-level docstring explaining its purpose, author, and version. Functions also have docstrings explaining their purpose and arguments.
-   Overall, naming conventions are consistent and align well with Python community standards (PEP 8). There are no apparent AI assumption errors in naming. The author is listed as "Pulse AI Engine."
