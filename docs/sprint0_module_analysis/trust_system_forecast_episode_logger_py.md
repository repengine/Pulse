# Module Analysis: `trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:1) module is to log symbolic episode metadata associated with forecasts. This metadata includes details such as arc labels, symbolic tags, overlay states, confidence levels, and timestamps. The module also provides utilities to read, summarize, and visualize this logged data, primarily focusing on the frequency of symbolic arcs.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete and operational for its defined scope. It successfully handles:
*   Logging individual and batch forecast episodes to a JSONL file.
*   Logging generic episode-related events.
*   Summarizing logged data by counting occurrences of symbolic tags and arc labels.
*   Generating a basic bar plot for symbolic arc frequency using `matplotlib`.

There are no explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders indicating unfinished core functionality.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Advanced Visualization:** The current plotting ([`plot_episode_arcs`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109)) is limited to arc distribution. Future enhancements could include:
    *   Plotting symbolic tag distribution.
    *   Visualizing confidence levels over time or per category.
    *   More interactive or configurable plotting options.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling in [`log_episode`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:52) and [`log_episode_event`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:152) uses a general `except Exception as e:`. More specific exception handling could improve robustness and debugging.
*   **Logging Mechanism:** The module uses a simple JSONL file ([`EPISODE_LOG_PATH`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:23)). For larger-scale applications or more complex querying needs, integration with a dedicated logging library (like Python's `logging` module with custom handlers) or a database system might be beneficial.
*   **Log Management:** No features for log rotation, archival, or size management are present. This could become an issue with a large volume of logs.
*   **Configuration:** The default log path is hardcoded. While functions allow overriding it, a more centralized configuration approach could be considered for such settings.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:**
    *   None are apparent from the module's content. It functions as a self-contained utility.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`os`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:16) (Python standard library): For path operations like creating directories.
    *   [`json`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:17) (Python standard library): For serializing log entries to JSON and deserializing them.
    *   [`datetime`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:18) (Python standard library): For timestamping log entries.
    *   [`typing`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:19) (Python standard library): For type hinting.
    *   [`matplotlib.pyplot`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:20): For generating bar charts of episode arc frequencies.
    *   [`collections.Counter`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:21) (Python standard library): Used in [`summarize_episodes`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68) for counting arc and tag occurrences.
*   **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    *   The module's primary interaction point is the log file, by default [`logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl`](logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl). Other modules would call functions like [`log_episode()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:26) to write to this file, or potentially read this file directly if needed (though using [`summarize_episodes()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68) is the intended method for consumption).
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Output:** [`logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl`](logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl). Log entries are appended in JSON Lines format.
    *   **Input:** [`logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl`](logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl) is read by [`summarize_episodes()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68) and subsequently by [`plot_episode_arcs()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

This module does not define any classes.

*   **[`log_episode(forecast: Dict, path: str = EPISODE_LOG_PATH) -> None`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:26):**
    Logs metadata from a single forecast object.
    ```python
    from trust_system.forecast_episode_logger import log_episode

    forecast_data = {
        "trace_id": "FX-2023-Q4-001",
        "arc_label": "consolidation_period",
        "symbolic_tag": "market_neutral",
        "confidence": 0.65,
        "overlays": {"volatility_index": "low", "external_event": None}
    }
    log_episode(forecast_data)
    # Appends an entry to logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl
    ```

*   **[`log_batch_episodes(forecasts: List[Dict], path: str = EPISODE_LOG_PATH) -> None`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:56):**
    Logs a list of forecast objects.
    ```python
    from trust_system.forecast_episode_logger import log_batch_episodes

    forecast_list = [
        {"trace_id": "FX-001", "arc_label": "uptrend", "symbolic_tag": "bullish", "confidence": 0.7},
        {"trace_id": "FX-002", "arc_label": "downtrend", "symbolic_tag": "bearish", "confidence": 0.8}
    ]
    log_batch_episodes(forecast_list)
    ```

*   **[`summarize_episodes(path: str = EPISODE_LOG_PATH) -> Dict[str, int]`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68):**
    Reads the log file and returns a summary dictionary.
    ```python
    from trust_system.forecast_episode_logger import summarize_episodes

    summary = summarize_episodes()
    # Example output:
    # {
    #     "total_episodes": 150,
    #     "unique_arcs": 5,
    #     "unique_tags": 10,
    #     "skipped_entries": 2,
    #     "arc_uptrend": 50,
    #     "arc_downtrend": 40,
    #     # ... other arcs and tags
    # }
    print(f"Total episodes: {summary.get('total_episodes')}")
    ```

*   **[`plot_episode_arcs(path: str = EPISODE_LOG_PATH)`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109):**
    Generates and displays a bar chart of symbolic arc frequencies.
    ```python
    from trust_system.forecast_episode_logger import plot_episode_arcs

    # This will attempt to display a matplotlib window with the plot.
    plot_episode_arcs()
    ```

*   **[`log_episode_event(event_type: str, payload: Any, path: str = EPISODE_LOG_PATH) -> None`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:133):**
    Logs a generic event related to forecast episodes.
    ```python
    from trust_system.forecast_episode_logger import log_episode_event

    log_episode_event(
        event_type="model_retrained",
        payload={"model_id": "alpha_v2", "accuracy": 0.88}
    )
    # Appends an event entry to logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Log Path:** [`EPISODE_LOG_PATH = "logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl"`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:23). While functions accept a `path` argument, this global constant defines the default location.
*   **Default "unknown" Values:** In [`log_episode()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:26), if keys like `"trace_id"`, `"arc_label"`, or `"symbolic_tag"` are missing from the input `forecast` dictionary, they default to the string `"unknown"`.
*   **Plot Styling:** Visual elements in [`plot_episode_arcs()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109) such as figure size (`figsize=(10, 4)`), bar color (`"slateblue"`), and title are hardcoded.
*   **Print Statements:** The module uses `print()` for status messages (e.g., "üß† Episode logged:", "‚ùå Failed to log episode:"). For a library module, using Python's `logging` module would be more conventional and flexible.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Forecast Data Structure:** The [`log_episode()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:26) function expects a specific structure for the `forecast` dictionary (e.g., keys like `"trace_id"`, `"arc_label"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, `"confidence"`, `"overlays"`). Changes to this data structure in other parts of the system that produce forecasts could break the logger or result in missing data in logs.
*   **File System:** The module is tightly coupled to the file system for reading and writing the JSONL log file ([`EPISODE_LOG_PATH`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:23)).
*   **`matplotlib` Dependency:** The [`plot_episode_arcs()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109) function introduces a dependency on `matplotlib`. If this is the only module using it, or if plotting is an optional feature, this could be a heavy dependency.

## 8. Existing Tests

The provided file list does not include a specific test file for `trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py` (e.g., `tests/trust_system/test_forecast_episode_logger.py`). Therefore, the state of dedicated unit tests for this module is presumed to be non-existent or not provided. Without tests, correctness and robustness under various inputs (e.g., malformed forecast data, file permission issues) cannot be easily verified.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module follows a procedural programming paradigm, consisting of a collection of functions. It does not utilize object-oriented programming (classes).
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Logging Functions:** [`log_episode()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:26), [`log_batch_episodes()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:56), [`log_episode_event()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:133). These handle the creation and writing of log entries.
    *   **Summarization Function:** [`summarize_episodes()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68). This function reads and processes the log file to produce aggregate statistics.
    *   **Visualization Function:** [`plot_episode_arcs()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109). This function uses the summary data to generate a plot.
*   **Primary Data/Control Flows:**
    1.  **Logging Flow:**
        *   An external component calls one of the `log_` functions, passing forecast data or event details.
        *   The function constructs a dictionary representing the log entry, including a UTC timestamp.
        *   The dictionary is serialized to a JSON string.
        *   The JSON string is appended as a new line to the file specified by `path` (defaults to [`EPISODE_LOG_PATH`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:23)).
        *   Directory for the log path is created if it doesn't exist.
    2.  **Summarization Flow:**
        *   [`summarize_episodes()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68) is called.
        *   It checks if the log file exists.
        *   It reads the log file line by line.
        *   Each line (JSON string) is parsed into a dictionary.
        *   `arc_label` and `symbolic_tag` are extracted and counted using `collections.Counter`.
        *   A summary dictionary containing total counts, unique counts, and individual counts for each arc/tag is returned.
    3.  **Plotting Flow:**
        *   [`plot_episode_arcs()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:109) is called.
        *   It calls [`summarize_episodes()`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:68) to get the data.
        *   It extracts arc-related counts from the summary.
        *   It uses `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and display a bar chart of these arc frequencies.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions and Variables:** Generally adhere to PEP 8 standards, using `snake_case` (e.g., [`log_episode`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:26), [`arc_label`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:40)).
*   **Constants:** The module-level constant [`EPISODE_LOG_PATH`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:23) is in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is conventional.
*   **Clarity:** Names are mostly descriptive and clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `forecast_id`, `symbolic_tag`, `summarize_episodes`).
*   **Short Names:** The variable `fc` is used for individual forecasts within the [`log_batch_episodes`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:64) loop. While short, its meaning is clear in the immediate context.
*   **Docstrings:** The module and its functions have docstrings. The module docstring includes "Author: Pulse AI Engine" and "Version: v1.0.1", which seems like metadata possibly inserted by an automated system.

No significant deviations from common Python naming conventions or PEP 8 were observed. The naming is consistent and understandable.
