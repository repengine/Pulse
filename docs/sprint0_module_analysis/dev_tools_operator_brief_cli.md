# Module Analysis: `dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The [`dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:1) module is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to generate an "Operator Brief." This brief is a markdown document summarizing key information derived from alignment-scored forecast files and symbolic episode logs. It also offers an optional feature to explain the rationale behind forecast license decisions.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **Command-Line Interface:** Utilizes [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to define and parse command-line arguments.
    *   Required arguments:
        *   `--alignment`: Path to an alignment-scored forecast file (JSONL format).
        *   `--episodes`: Path to a symbolic episode log file (JSONL format).
    *   Optional arguments:
        *   `--export`: Output path for the generated markdown brief (default: `operator_brief.md`).
        *   `--topk`: Number of top-N forecasts to include in the brief (default: 5).
        *   `--previous-episodes`: Path to a prior episode log for drift comparison (optional).
        *   `--explain`: A boolean flag to print the rationale for each forecast's license decision.
*   **License Explanation (Optional):** If the `--explain` flag is used:
    *   It reads the alignment-scored forecast file ([`args.alignment`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:31)).
    *   For each forecast, it calls [`explain_forecast_license(fc)`](trust_system/license_explainer.py) from the `trust_system.license_explainer` module.
    *   Prints the trace ID and the explanation to the console ([`dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:33-35`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:33-35)).
*   **Operator Brief Generation:**
    *   Calls the [`generate_operator_brief()`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) function from the `operator_interface.operator_brief_generator` module.
    *   Passes the parsed command-line arguments (alignment file, episode log, output path, top-k, previous episode log) to this function to produce the markdown brief.

## 3. Role within `dev_tools/`

This script serves as a developer and operator tool. It provides a convenient way to generate consolidated reports (Operator Briefs) from various system outputs (forecasts, episode logs). This can be used for monitoring, analysis, and understanding system behavior, particularly concerning forecast performance and licensing.

## 4. Dependencies

### Standard Libraries
*   [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
*   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) (imported conditionally if `--explain` is used)

### Internal Pulse Modules
*   [`operator_interface.operator_brief_generator.generate_operator_brief`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py)
*   [`trust_system.license_explainer.explain_forecast_license`](trust_system/license_explainer.py)

### External Libraries
*   None apparent directly within this script, but dependencies may exist within the imported `operator_interface` and `trust_system` modules.

## 5. SPARC Principles Adherence

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:** Clearly defined by its name and docstring ([`dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:3-11`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:3-11)). It aims to provide a summarized view for operators.
*   **Operational Status/Completeness:** The script appears complete for its defined task of generating an operator brief and optionally explaining licenses.
*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   The content and structure of the "alignment-scored forecast file," "symbolic episode log," and the generated "operator_brief.md" are determined by the imported modules.
    *   Error handling for file I/O within the `--explain` block is basic (uses `with open`, but no explicit `try-except` for `json.loads` or file issues beyond `open` itself). The main [`generate_operator_brief`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) function is assumed to handle its own errors.
*   **Connections & Dependencies:**
    *   Strongly connected to [`operator_interface.operator_brief_generator`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) for the core brief generation.
    *   Connected to [`trust_system.license_explainer`](trust_system/license_explainer.py) for the license explanation feature.
*   **Function and Class Example Usages:**
    The script is intended to be run from the command line as shown in its docstring:
    ```bash
    python dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py \
      --alignment data/alignment_output.jsonl \
      --episodes logs/forecast_episodes.jsonl \
      --export operator_brief.md \
      --topk 10 \
      --explain
    ```
*   **Hardcoding Issues:**
    *   The default output filename `operator_brief.md` ([`dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:21`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:21)) is hardcoded but can be overridden by the user.
    *   The default `topk` value of `5` ([`dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:22`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:22)) is hardcoded but configurable.
*   **Coupling Points:**
    *   Tightly coupled to the API of [`generate_operator_brief()`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) and [`explain_forecast_license()`](trust_system/license_explainer.py). Changes to these functions' signatures or behavior would require updates to this CLI script.
    *   Depends on the specific JSONL format of the input files.
*   **Existing Tests:** No tests are included with this module. Testing would involve creating sample input JSONL files and verifying the output markdown or console printout for the `--explain` feature.
*   **Module Architecture and Flow:**
    1.  The [`main()`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:17) function initializes an [`ArgumentParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser).
    2.  It defines several command-line arguments (`--alignment`, `--episodes`, `--export`, `--topk`, `--previous-episodes`, `--explain`).
    3.  Parses the provided arguments.
    4.  If [`args.explain`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:28) is true:
        *   It imports [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html).
        *   Prints a header.
        *   Opens and reads the `args.alignment` file line by line.
        *   For each line (forecast), it calls [`explain_forecast_license()`](trust_system/license_explainer.py) and prints the result.
    5.  Calls [`generate_operator_brief()`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) with the relevant parsed arguments to generate the markdown report.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Functions ([`main`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:17)) and variables (`parser`, `args`, `f`, `forecasts`, `fc`, `explanation`) use `snake_case`.
    *   Imported functions also follow `snake_case`.
    These are standard Python conventions.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness:** The script is complete for its role as a CLI wrapper for generating operator briefs and explaining licenses.
*   **Quality:**
    *   The code is clear and well-structured.
    *   [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) is used effectively for CLI argument handling.
    *   The separation of concerns, where core logic resides in imported modules ([`operator_interface.operator_brief_generator`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py), [`trust_system.license_explainer`](trust_system/license_explainer.py)), is good practice.
    *   The conditional import of [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) is a minor optimization.
    *   The script could be enhanced with more robust error handling, especially around file operations and JSON parsing in the `--explain` block.
    *   The docstring provides a clear usage example.

## 7. Note for Main Report

The [`dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py`](dev_tools/operator_brief_cli.py:1) module provides a command-line interface to generate markdown-based Operator Briefs from forecast alignment and episode logs, and can optionally explain forecast license decisions, relying on `operator_interface` and `trust_system` components.
