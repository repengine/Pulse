# Analysis of trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py

**Module Path:** [`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:498)

**Original Line Number in Inventory:** 498

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose
The `UpgradeGatekeeper` module is designed to control the promotion of \"epistemic/symbolic upgrades\" within the Pulse system. Its core responsibilities are:
-   Loading pending upgrade proposals from a designated \"sandbox\" location (stored as JSONL files).
-   Evaluating the trustworthiness of each upgrade proposal using a scoring mechanism. Currently, this scoring is based on simple heuristics but is intended to be replaced or augmented by a more sophisticated system (e.g., `trust_system.trust_engine.evaluate_upgrade_trust_score`).
-   Making a decision to either \"approve\" or \"quarantine\" an upgrade based on whether its trust score meets a defined threshold.
-   Storing approved upgrades in a separate location for potential live injection into the system.
-   Storing quarantined upgrades for review or further analysis.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness
-   The module provides a basic, functional workflow for managing upgrades: loading, scoring, deciding, and storing.
-   The file I/O operations for reading and appending to JSONL files are implemented.
-   The core class structure and methods are in place.
-   **Placeholder/Simplified Scoring:** The `score_upgrade` method ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:51`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:51)) is explicitly a simplified version with comments like \"Example heuristics â€” extend later.\" A placeholder import `from trust_system.trust_engine import evaluate_upgrade_trust_score` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:16`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:16)) indicates a planned integration for more advanced scoring.
-   No explicit `TODO` comments beyond the implication of extending the scoring logic.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
-   **Signs of intended extension:**
    -   The primary area for extension is the `score_upgrade` method ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:51`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:51)), which needs to be replaced or enhanced with a robust trust evaluation mechanism, likely by integrating the commented-out `evaluate_upgrade_trust_score` from the `TrustEngine`.
    -   The definition of what constitutes an \"upgrade\" (the schema of the upgrade dictionary) is implicit and could be formalized.
-   **Implied but missing features/modules:**
    -   A mechanism to actually *apply* the approved upgrades to the live Pulse system. This module only gates them.
    -   A review process or interface for quarantined upgrades.
    -   More detailed logging or event tracking for upgrade decisions.
    -   Error handling for malformed upgrade proposal files could be more robust.
    -   Integration with version control or a more sophisticated change management system for upgrades.
-   **Indications of deviated/stopped development:**
    -   The development of the scoring mechanism is clearly in an early stage. The rest of the file management workflow seems complete for a first pass.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies
-   **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    -   None are currently active. The line `from trust_system.trust_engine import evaluate_upgrade_trust_score` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:16`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:16)) is commented out, indicating a planned future dependency.
-   **External library dependencies:**
    -   `json` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:11`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:11)) (Python standard library): For serializing and deserializing upgrade data.
    -   `os` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:12`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:12)) (Python standard library): For path manipulations (`os.path.join`) and directory creation (`os.makedirs`).
    -   `typing.Dict, Any, List, Optional` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:13`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:13)) (Python standard library).
-   **Interaction with other modules:**
    -   It expects another part of the system to generate upgrade proposals and place them in the `pending_upgrades.jsonl` file.
    -   It expects another part of the system to consume the `approved_upgrades.jsonl` file to apply the changes.
    -   It is intended to eventually call out to the `TrustEngine` for scoring.
-   **Input/output files:**
    -   Reads pending upgrades from: `self.pending_upgrades_path` (e.g., `data/pulsemind_sandbox/pending_upgrades.jsonl`) ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:33`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:33)).
    -   Writes approved upgrades to: `self.approved_upgrades_path` (e.g., `data/pulsemind_approved/approved_upgrades.jsonl`) ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:34`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:34)).
    -   Writes quarantined upgrades to: `self.quarantine_path` (e.g., `data/pulsemind_sandbox/quarantined_upgrades.jsonl`) ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:35`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:35)).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages
-   **`UpgradeGatekeeper` class:**
    ```python
    import os
    import json
    # from trust_system.upgrade_gatekeeper import UpgradeGatekeeper # Assuming the class is imported

    # Example setup:
    # test_sandbox_dir = \"temp_test_sandbox\"
    # test_approved_dir = \"temp_test_approved\"
    # os.makedirs(test_sandbox_dir, exist_ok=True)
    #
    # # Create a dummy pending upgrades file
    # dummy_pending_path = os.path.join(test_sandbox_dir, \"pending_upgrades.jsonl\")
    # sample_upgrades_data = [
    #     {\"upgrade_id\": \"UPG001\", \"description\": \"High quality upgrade\", \"proposed_variables\": [\"v1\"], \"proposed_consequences\": [\"c1\"], \"details\": \"Contains trust and coherence keywords.\"},
    #     {\"upgrade_id\": \"UPG002\", \"description\": \"Low quality upgrade\", \"details\": \"No special keywords.\"}
    # ]
    # with open(dummy_pending_path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:
    #     for upg_data in sample_upgrades_data:
    #         f.write(json.dumps(upg_data) + \"\\n\")

    # gatekeeper_instance = UpgradeGatekeeper(sandbox_dir=test_sandbox_dir, approved_dir=test_approved_dir, trust_threshold=0.75)

    # # Load pending upgrades
    # pending = gatekeeper_instance.load_pending_upgrades()
    # print(f\"Found {len(pending)} pending upgrades.\")

    # # Process each upgrade
    # for upgrade_proposal in pending:
    #     decision = gatekeeper_instance.approve_or_quarantine(upgrade_proposal)
    #     print(f\"Upgrade ID: {upgrade_proposal.get('upgrade_id', 'N/A')}, Score: {upgrade_proposal.get('trust_score', 'N/A')}, Decision: {decision}\")

    # # Promote (load) approved upgrades
    # approved_upgrades_list = gatekeeper_instance.promote_approved_upgrades()
    # print(f\"Found {len(approved_upgrades_list)} approved upgrades.\")
    # for approved_upg in approved_upgrades_list:
    #     print(f\"  Approved: {approved_upg.get('upgrade_id')}\")
    #
    # # Cleanup (optional, for test environments)
    # # os.remove(dummy_pending_path)
    # # if os.path.exists(gatekeeper_instance.approved_upgrades_path): os.remove(gatekeeper_instance.approved_upgrades_path)
    # # if os.path.exists(gatekeeper_instance.quarantine_path): os.remove(gatekeeper_instance.quarantine_path)
    # # if os.path.exists(test_approved_dir): os.rmdir(test_approved_dir)
    # # if os.path.exists(test_sandbox_dir): os.rmdir(test_sandbox_dir)
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues
-   **Default Directory Paths:** `sandbox_dir` and `approved_dir` default to `\"data/pulsemind_sandbox\"` and `\"data/pulsemind_approved\"` respectively ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:19`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:19)). While configurable via constructor, these defaults tie it to a specific project structure if not overridden.
-   **Filenames:** The names `pending_upgrades.jsonl`, `approved_upgrades.jsonl`, and `quarantined_upgrades.jsonl` are hardcoded within the `__init__` method ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:33-35`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:33-35)).
-   **Scoring Logic:** The entire logic within `score_upgrade` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:61-71`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:61-71)) is hardcoded:
    -   Base score: `0.5`.
    -   Increment for `proposed_variables`: `0.2`.
    -   Increment for `proposed_consequences`: `0.2`.
    -   Increment for keywords \"trust\" or \"coherence\": `0.1`.
    This is explicitly noted as needing extension.
-   **Default Trust Threshold:** `trust_threshold` defaults to `0.7` ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:19`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:19)), which is a reasonable default but might need tuning for different environments.

## 7. Coupling Points
-   **File System Structure:** Relies on specific directory structures and filenames for its operation, although base directories are configurable.
-   **JSONL Format:** Assumes upgrades are stored one JSON object per line.
-   **Upgrade Proposal Schema:** Implicitly expects certain keys in the upgrade dictionaries (e.g., `proposed_variables`, `proposed_consequences`, `upgrade_id`). The exact schema is not formally defined or validated by this module.
-   **Future `TrustEngine` Coupling:** The commented-out import suggests a future tight coupling with the `TrustEngine` for scoring logic.

## 8. Existing Tests
-   A search for `tests/test_upgrade_gatekeeper.py` yielded no results.
-   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ([`trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:112`](trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py:112)) provides a basic command-line interface for testing the workflow. This serves as a simple smoke test but is not a comprehensive unit testing suite.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow
-   **`UpgradeGatekeeper` Class:**
    -   **`__init__`:** Sets up directory paths for sandbox, approved, and quarantined upgrades. Creates the approved directory if it doesn't exist. Stores the trust threshold.
    -   **`load_pending_upgrades()`:** Reads `pending_upgrades.jsonl`, parsing each line as a JSON object, and returns a list of these upgrade dictionaries.
    -   **`score_upgrade(upgrade)`:** Implements the current simplified scoring heuristic based on the presence of certain keys and keywords in the upgrade dictionary.
    -   **`approve_or_quarantine(upgrade)`:**
        1.  Scores the upgrade using `self.score_upgrade()`.
        2.  Adds the calculated `trust_score` to the upgrade dictionary.
        3.  If the score meets `self.trust_threshold`, appends the upgrade to `approved_upgrades.jsonl` and returns \"approved\".
        4.  Otherwise, appends it to `quarantined_upgrades.jsonl` and returns \"quarantined\".
    -   **`promote_approved_upgrades()`:** Reads `approved_upgrades.jsonl` and returns a list of approved upgrade dictionaries.
-   **Execution Flow (from `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**
    1.  Instantiates `UpgradeGatekeeper`.
    2.  Loads pending upgrades.
    3.  Iterates through pending upgrades, deciding to approve or quarantine each.
    4.  Loads and prints the total count of approved upgrades.

## 10. Naming Conventions
-   **Class:** `UpgradeGatekeeper` (PascalCase) - Standard.
-   **Methods:** snake_case (e.g., `load_pending_upgrades`, `score_upgrade`) - Standard.
-   **Attributes/Variables:** snake_case (e.g., `sandbox_dir`, `trust_threshold`, `pending_upgrades_path`) - Standard.
-   The naming is clear, descriptive, and adheres to Python conventions.
