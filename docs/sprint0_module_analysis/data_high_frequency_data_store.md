# Module Analysis: `data/high_frequency_data_store.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary purpose of the [`data/high_frequency_data_store.py`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:1) module is to provide a simple mechanism for storing high-frequency time-series data. It allows for appending data points for various named variables into separate JSON Lines (JSONL) files. Each data point typically consists of a timestamp, a value, and optional metadata.

Its role within the `data/` directory is to serve as a basic persistence layer for frequently arriving data streams, likely from sensors, metrics, or other real-time sources.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **Initialization**: The [`HighFrequencyDataStore`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:5) class is initialized with a `base_dir` (defaulting to [`"data/high_frequency_data"`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:6)), where data files will be stored. The directory is created if it doesn't exist.
*   **File Path Generation**: The internal method [`_get_file_path(self, variable_name)`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:10) constructs the full path for a variable's data file (e.g., `data/high_frequency_data/my_variable.jsonl`).
*   **Data Point Storage**: The [`store_data_point(self, variable_name, timestamp, value, metadata=None)`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:14) method takes a variable name, timestamp, value, and optional metadata. It serializes this information into a JSON object and appends it as a new line to the corresponding variable's `.jsonl` file. Timestamps are converted to ISO format if they are `datetime` objects.
*   **Storage Initialization (Placeholder)**: The [`initialize_storage(self)`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:25) method is currently a placeholder, as the primary directory creation logic is handled in the `__init__` method.

## 3. Dependencies

### External Libraries:
*   `json`: Used for serializing data points into JSON strings.
*   `os`: Used for path manipulation (e.g., [`os.path.join()`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:12)) and directory creation ([`os.makedirs()`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:8)).
*   `datetime` (from `datetime`): Used for handling timestamp objects and converting them to ISO format.

### Internal Pulse Modules:
*   No direct dependencies on other Pulse modules are apparent from the provided code.

## 4. SPARC Principles Assessment

### Operational Status/Completeness
*   The module is operational for its core function: appending data points to files.
*   It is incomplete as a comprehensive data storage solution as it lacks functionalities for:
    *   Reading/querying stored data.
    *   Updating or deleting data points.
    *   Data validation before storage.
    *   Error handling for file I/O beyond basic Python exceptions.
    *   Managing file sizes, data rotation, or archiving.

### Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
*   **Data Retrieval**: No methods exist to read or query the stored data. Users would need to manually parse the JSONL files.
*   **Error Handling**: Could be enhanced (e.g., try-except blocks for file operations, logging).
*   **Data Management**: Lacks features for managing large datasets, such as log rotation, archiving, or indexing.
*   **Concurrency**: No explicit handling for concurrent writes, which might be an issue in a high-frequency scenario (though appending to files is often relatively safe at the OS level for separate processes, in-process concurrency might need locks).
*   The [`initialize_storage()`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:25) method is a no-op and could be removed or implemented if more complex initialization is needed.

### Connections & Dependencies
*   The module is tightly coupled to the local file system for storage.
*   It relies on standard Python libraries (`json`, `os`, `datetime`).

### Function and Class Example Usages
```python
from datetime import datetime
# Assuming the class is accessible, e.g., from data.high_frequency_data_store import HighFrequencyDataStore

# Initialize the store (creates 'temp_hf_data' directory if not exists)
store = HighFrequencyDataStore(base_dir="temp_hf_data")

# Prepare data
variable1 = "sensor_temp_celsius"
timestamp1 = datetime.now()
value1 = 25.5
metadata1 = {"location": "room_a", "sensor_id": "xyz123"}

variable2 = "system_load_avg"
timestamp2 = "2023-10-27T14:30:00Z" # Can also be an ISO formatted string
value2 = 0.65
metadata2 = {"host": "server01"}

# Store data points
store.store_data_point(variable1, timestamp1, value1, metadata1)
store.store_data_point(variable2, timestamp2, value2, metadata2)
store.store_data_point(variable1, datetime.now(), 25.8, metadata1) # Another point for variable1

# To view the data, one would typically inspect the files:
# temp_hf_data/sensor_temp_celsius.jsonl
# temp_hf_data/system_load_avg.jsonl
```

### Hardcoding Issues
*   The default `base_dir` is hardcoded to [`"data/high_frequency_data"`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:6). While this is configurable during instantiation, it implies a specific project structure if not overridden.
*   The file extension `.jsonl` is hardcoded in [`_get_file_path()`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:12).

### Coupling Points
*   **Storage Mechanism**: Tightly coupled to the file system and JSONL format. Changing the backend (e.g., to a database, different file format) would require significant refactoring.
*   **Data Structure**: Assumes data points can be represented as a dictionary with "timestamp", "value", and "metadata" keys.

### Existing Tests
*   No tests are provided within this module. Testing would involve file system interactions and verification of file content.

### Module Architecture and Flow
*   The architecture is a simple class-based design.
*   The flow for storing a data point is:
    1.  Receive `variable_name`, `timestamp`, `value`, `metadata`.
    2.  Generate the target file path using [`_get_file_path()`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:10).
    3.  Format the data into a dictionary.
    4.  Convert the dictionary to a JSON string.
    5.  Open the file in append mode (`"a"`) and write the JSON string followed by a newline.

### Naming Conventions
*   Class name [`HighFrequencyDataStore`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:5) uses PascalCase.
*   Method names (e.g., [`store_data_point`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:14), [`_get_file_path`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:10)) use snake_case.
*   The underscore prefix in [`_get_file_path`](data/high_frequency_data_store.py:10) appropriately suggests it's intended for internal use.
*   Variable names are generally clear and follow snake_case.

## 5. Overall Assessment

### Completeness
The module provides the basic, essential functionality for its stated purpose of appending high-frequency data. However, it is far from a complete data management solution due to the lack of retrieval, update, deletion, querying, robust error handling, and data lifecycle management features.

### Quality
*   **Clarity**: The code is straightforward, well-commented where necessary (docstrings), and easy to understand.
*   **Simplicity**: It adheres to the SPARC principle of simplicity for its defined scope.
*   **Maintainability**: For its current size and complexity, it's maintainable. Significant feature additions would require careful design to maintain this.
*   **Robustness**: Basic. It relies on Python's default file handling. More advanced error handling, data validation, and considerations for concurrent access would improve robustness.
*   **Extensibility**: Limited in its current form. Adding new storage backends or complex querying would require substantial changes.

The module serves as a good foundational component for logging data but would need significant enhancements to be considered a production-grade data store.
