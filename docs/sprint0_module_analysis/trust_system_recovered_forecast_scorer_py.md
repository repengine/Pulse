# Analysis of trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary purpose of `trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py` is to assess and process forecasts that have undergone a \"recovery\" procedure, presumably aimed at improving their quality or stability after initial generation. This module acts as a post-recovery quality control step.

Key responsibilities include:
-   **Re-scoring and Annotation:** Re-evaluating recovered forecasts by annotating them with fresh license status and explanations using the [`trust_system.license_enforcer`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:17).
-   **Instability Flagging:** Identifying and flagging forecasts that, despite recovery attempts, still exhibit signs of instability. Instability criteria include:
    -   Low alignment score (below a defined threshold).
    -   A trust label that is not \"ðŸŸ¢ Trusted\".
    -   Presence of a drift flag.
    Forecasts meeting these criteria are marked with `symbolic_revision_needed = True`.
-   **Summarization:** Providing a summary of the repair quality by counting the total number of repaired forecasts, how many are still unstable, and how many are now considered stable.
-   **Exporting:** Allowing for the export of forecasts that have been flagged as needing further symbolic revision to a JSONL file.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope.
-   **Core Functions:** All described functionalities (scoring, flagging, summarizing, exporting) are implemented.
-   **Dependencies:** It correctly utilizes [`trust_system.license_enforcer`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:17) for re-applying license logic.
-   **Clarity:** The logic for flagging unstable forecasts is straightforward and based on clear, configurable (though defaults are used in the code) thresholds and conditions.
-   **Output:** Provides both in-memory modification of forecast lists and file output for flagged forecasts.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **Signs of Intended Extension:**
    -   The instability criteria in [`flag_unstable_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30) (e.g., `align_threshold`, `trust_required`) are hardcoded as default arguments. This suggests they could be made more configurable, perhaps loaded from a central configuration or passed dynamically.
    -   The module mentions \"fragility or symbolic volatility\" in its docstring as reasons for instability, but these are not explicitly checked in the [`flag_unstable_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30) function. This might indicate an area for future enhancement or that these aspects are expected to be captured by the `trust_label` or `drift_flag`.
-   **Implied but Missing Features/Modules:**
    -   **Detailed Instability Reasons:** While a forecast is flagged as `symbolic_revision_needed`, the specific reason(s) (low alignment, wrong trust label, drift) are not stored alongside the flag. This could be useful for downstream revision processes.
    -   **Integration with \"Symbolic Sweep\":** The docstring mentions \"forecasts recovered via symbolic sweep.\" The exact nature of this \"symbolic sweep\" and how this module integrates into that broader workflow is not detailed here but is implied.
-   **Indications of Deviated/Stopped Development:**
    -   No strong indications of stopped development. The module is focused and seems to fulfill its current role. The potential for more sophisticated instability checks (like fragility) could be a future enhancement rather than a sign of stopped work.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

-   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:**
    -   From [`trust_system.license_enforcer`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:17):
        -   [`annotate_forecasts()`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:21)
        -   [`filter_licensed()`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:34) (Note: `filter_licensed` is imported but not actually used in this module's code.)
-   **External Library Dependencies:**
    -   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): Used in [`export_flagged_for_revision()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:66) for writing forecasts to a JSONL file.
    -   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html): Used for type hints (`List`, `Dict`).
-   **Interaction with Other Modules (Implied):**
    -   **Input:** This module expects a list of \"recovered\" forecast dictionaries as input. These would likely come from a module responsible for the recovery process (e.g., a \"symbolic sweep\" module).
    -   **Output:**
        -   The modified list of forecasts (with new annotations and flags) is returned by its functions, presumably for further processing or storage.
        -   [`export_flagged_for_revision()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:66) writes data that might be consumed by a manual review tool or an automated symbolic revision system.
-   **Input/Output Files:**
    -   **Output:** [`export_flagged_for_revision()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:66) writes to a user-specified `path`. This file contains forecasts marked as needing symbolic revision.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

-   **Re-scoring recovered forecasts:**
    ```python
    from trust_system.recovered_forecast_scorer import score_recovered_forecasts
    recovered_forecasts = [{\"trace_id\": \"rec_001\", \"confidence\": 0.7, ...}, ...]
    annotated_forecasts = score_recovered_forecasts(recovered_forecasts)
    # Each forecast in annotated_forecasts now has 'license_status' and 'license_explanation'
    ```
-   **Flagging unstable forecasts:**
    ```python
    from trust_system.recovered_forecast_scorer import flag_unstable_forecasts
    # Assume annotated_forecasts from previous example
    # Default thresholds: align_threshold=70, trust_required=\"ðŸŸ¢ Trusted\"
    flagged_forecasts = flag_unstable_forecasts(annotated_forecasts)
    for fc in flagged_forecasts:
        if fc.get(\"symbolic_revision_needed\"):
            print(f\"Forecast {fc['trace_id']} needs revision.\")
    ```
-   **Summarizing repair quality:**
    ```python
    from trust_system.recovered_forecast_scorer import summarize_repair_quality
    # Assume flagged_forecasts from previous example
    summary = summarize_repair_quality(flagged_forecasts)
    # Output: {'total_repaired': X, 'still_unstable': Y, 'stable_now': Z}
    print(summary)
    ```
-   **Exporting forecasts needing revision:**
    ```python
    from trust_system.recovered_forecast_scorer import export_flagged_for_revision
    # Assume flagged_forecasts from previous example
    export_flagged_for_revision(flagged_forecasts, path=\"data/needs_revision.jsonl\")
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Thresholds in `flag_unstable_forecasts`:**
    -   `align_threshold=70`
    -   `trust_required=\"ðŸŸ¢ Trusted\"`
    -   These are hardcoded as default function arguments.
    -   **Pro:** Provides sensible defaults.
    -   **Con:** If these thresholds need to be tuned or vary based on context, modification requires changing the function signature or passing them explicitly every time.
    -   **Mitigation/Recommendation:** Consider making these configurable, perhaps by loading them from a central configuration file (e.g., from `core.pulse_config`) or allowing them to be passed as part of a `thresholds` dictionary similar to `trust_system.forecast_licensing_shell.license_forecast`.
-   **Specific Key Names:** The module relies on specific keys being present in the forecast dictionaries (e.g., `\"license_status\"`, `\"alignment_score\"`, `\"trust_label\"`, `\"drift_flag\"`). This is standard practice but creates coupling.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **[`trust_system.license_enforcer`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:17):** Tightly coupled to [`annotate_forecasts()`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:21) from this module for re-applying license status and explanations. Changes in the `license_enforcer`'s output or behavior could impact this module.
-   **Forecast Dictionary Structure:** Like many modules in the system, it's coupled to the expected structure of forecast dictionaries and the specific keys used for trust-related metadata.
-   **Instability Criteria:** The logic in [`flag_unstable_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30) is directly tied to the current definition of instability. If new criteria (e.g., fragility scores) are added, this function would need modification.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   No inline `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` test block or dedicated test files are apparent for this module from the provided content.
-   **Assessment:** The module lacks explicit tests.
-   **Recommendation:** Create a dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/trust_system/test_recovered_forecast_scorer.py`) using `pytest`. Tests should cover:
    -   Correct annotation by [`score_recovered_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:20) (mocking `annotate_forecasts`).
    -   Various scenarios for [`flag_unstable_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30) to ensure correct flagging based on different combinations of alignment, trust label, and drift.
    -   Correct counting in [`summarize_repair_quality()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:52).
    -   Proper file output and filtering by [`export_flagged_for_revision()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:66).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

-   **Procedural Design:** The module consists of a set of independent functions that operate on lists of forecast dictionaries.
-   **Workflow:**
    1.  [`score_recovered_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:20) is called first to re-annotate forecasts with license information. This internally calls [`annotate_forecasts()`](trust_system/license_enforcer.py:21) from the `license_enforcer`.
    2.  The annotated forecasts are then passed to [`flag_unstable_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30) to mark those needing revision.
    3.  [`summarize_repair_quality()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:52) can be used on the output of step 2 to get statistics.
    4.  [`export_flagged_for_revision()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:66) can also be used on the output of step 2 to save problematic forecasts.
-   **Data Modification:** Functions like [`score_recovered_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:20) (via `annotate_forecasts`) and [`flag_unstable_forecasts()`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30) modify the input list of forecast dictionaries in-place by adding/updating keys.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Module Name:** `recovered_forecast_scorer.py` is descriptive.
-   **Function Names:** Clear and follow `snake_case` (e.g., [`score_recovered_forecasts`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:20), [`flag_unstable_forecasts`](trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py:30)).
-   **Variable Names:** Generally clear and use `snake_case` (e.g., `align_threshold`, `trust_required`, `needs_revision`).
-   **Constants:** No module-level constants are defined.
-   **Overall:** Naming is consistent and Pythonic.
