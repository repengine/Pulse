# Analysis of `trust_system/bayesian_trust_tracker.py` (Inferred from `tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`)

**Note:** The module `trust_system/bayesian_trust_tracker.py` was not found. This analysis is based on inferences drawn from its test file, [`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:). The actual module is expected to reside at `core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py` based on the import `from core.bayesian_trust_tracker import bayesian_trust_tracker` in the test file.

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the `bayesian_trust_tracker` module (expected at [`core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py)) appears to be tracking, updating, and quantifying the trustworthiness of various entities within the system, such as rules or variables. It likely employs Bayesian statistical methods to update trust scores based on observed outcomes and provides these scores along with confidence intervals.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness (Inferred)

Based on the single test case in [`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:), the `bayesian_trust_tracker` module seems to have the core functionalities implemented:
*   Updating trust for an entity based on a boolean outcome.
*   Retrieving the current trust score for an entity.
*   Retrieving a confidence interval (presumably 95%) for an entity's trust score.

The test [`test_bayesian_updates()`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:3) successfully simulates updates and checks if trust scores are within the valid [0, 1] range.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps (Inferred)

The existing test is quite basic and suggests potential areas for expansion or features that might be missing in the `core.bayesian_trust_tracker` module:
*   **Limited Test Coverage:** The single test covers a straightforward scenario. The module might lack robustness if not tested for edge cases (e.g., no updates yet for an ID, long sequences of identical outcomes, division by zero if not handled by Bayesian priors).
*   **Initialization/Priors:** The test does not show how prior beliefs or initial trust states are handled. A production-ready Bayesian tracker usually allows setting priors (e.g., initial alpha and beta parameters for a Beta distribution).
*   **Error Handling:** The test doesn't probe error conditions (e.g., querying an untracked entity ID before any updates).
*   **Advanced Features:** There's no indication of more advanced features like:
    *   Trust decay over time.
    *   Handling different weights or types of evidence.
    *   Mechanisms for resetting or forgetting trust.
    *   Batch update capabilities.
*   **State Management:** How the tracker's state is persisted or managed across sessions is not evident.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies (Inferred)

*   **Internal Project Dependencies:**
    *   The test file directly imports `bayesian_trust_tracker` from [`core.bayesian_trust_tracker`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:1). This indicates the actual module is expected to be part of the `core` package.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   While not explicit in the test file, a module performing Bayesian updates and calculating confidence intervals (likely using a Beta distribution) would typically depend on a library like `scipy.stats` for these calculations, unless implemented from scratch.
*   **Interaction with Other Modules:**
    *   The `bayesian_trust_tracker` is designed to be a service module, called by other parts of the system that need to assess the reliability of rules, variables, or other information sources.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   No direct file I/O is indicated by the test. The tracker likely operates in memory, though persistence mechanisms are unknown.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages (Inferred API)

Based on [`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:), the `bayesian_trust_tracker` object (instance or module) exposes the following API:

*   [`bayesian_trust_tracker.update(entity_id: str, outcome: bool)`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:9)
    *   **Purpose:** Updates the trust metrics for the given `entity_id` based on the boolean `outcome` (True for a positive/successful outcome, False for a negative/failed one).
    *   **Example:** `bayesian_trust_tracker.update("rule_X", True)`

*   [`bayesian_trust_tracker.get_trust(entity_id: str) -> float`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:11)
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieves the current trust score (a float between 0 and 1) for the specified `entity_id`.
    *   **Example:** `rule_trust = bayesian_trust_tracker.get_trust("rule_X")`

*   [`bayesian_trust_tracker.get_confidence_interval(entity_id: str) -> tuple[float, float]`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:12)
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieves the confidence interval (e.g., 95%) for the trust score of the `entity_id`. Returns a tuple of (lower_bound, upper_bound).
    *   **Example:** `rule_ci = bayesian_trust_tracker.get_confidence_interval("rule_X")`

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **In the Test File:**
    *   `rule_id = "rule_X"` ([`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:4`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:4))
    *   `var_id = "var_Y"` ([`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:5`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:5))
    *   The `outcomes` list `[True, True, False, True, False, False, True, True, True, False]` ([`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:7`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:7)) is hardcoded test data.
    These are standard for test cases.
*   **In the Inferred Module (`core.bayesian_trust_tracker`):**
    *   It's not possible to determine internal hardcoding from the test file alone. However, parameters for Bayesian calculations (like initial alpha/beta values if not configurable) could potentially be hardcoded.

## 7. Coupling Points (Inferred)

The `core.bayesian_trust_tracker` module would be coupled with:
*   Any system component that needs to make decisions based on the trustworthiness of rules, data sources, or other entities. These components would call the `update`, `get_trust`, and `get_confidence_interval` methods.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   The analysis is based on the single test file [`tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:).
*   It contains one test function: [`test_bayesian_updates()`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:3).
*   This test covers the basic workflow: updating trust for two entities based on a series of outcomes and then retrieving their trust scores and confidence intervals. It asserts that the trust scores fall within the expected [0, 1] range.
*   **Coverage:** The coverage provided by this single test for the `core.bayesian_trust_tracker` module is likely minimal, focusing on the "happy path." It does not appear to cover initialization options, error states, edge cases, or more complex interaction patterns.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (Inferred for `core.bayesian_trust_tracker`)

The `bayesian_trust_tracker` likely operates as follows:
1.  **State:** Maintains an internal data structure (e.g., a dictionary) mapping `entity_id`s to their trust parameters. For Bayesian updates with binary outcomes, this typically involves storing two values per entity, often representing successes (alpha) and failures (beta) if using a Beta distribution as the conjugate prior for a Bernoulli/Binomial likelihood.
2.  **`update(entity_id, outcome)`:**
    *   Retrieves the current parameters for `entity_id`.
    *   If `outcome` is True, increments the success count (alpha).
    *   If `outcome` is False, increments the failure count (beta).
3.  **`get_trust(entity_id)`:**
    *   Retrieves parameters (alpha, beta) for `entity_id`.
    *   Calculates the trust score, typically the mean of the posterior Beta distribution (e.g., `alpha / (alpha + beta)`).
4.  **`get_confidence_interval(entity_id)`:**
    *   Retrieves parameters (alpha, beta) for `entity_id`.
    *   Calculates the desired confidence interval (e.g., 95%) from the posterior Beta distribution (e.g., using `scipy.stats.beta.interval(0.95, alpha, beta)`).

## 10. Naming Conventions (Inferred API and Test)

*   **Module/Object:** `bayesian_trust_tracker` (snake_case) is appropriate.
*   **Test File:** [`test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:) (follows pytest conventions).
*   **Test Function:** [`test_bayesian_updates()`](tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py:3) (follows `test_` prefix convention).
*   **Variables in Test:** `rule_id`, `var_id`, `outcomes`, `rule_trust`, `rule_ci` are descriptive and use snake_case.
*   **API Methods:** `update`, `get_trust`, `get_confidence_interval` are clear, action-oriented, and follow Python's snake_case convention for methods.
The naming appears consistent with PEP 8 and common Python practices.
