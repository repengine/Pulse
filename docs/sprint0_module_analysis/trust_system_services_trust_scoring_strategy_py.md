# Analysis of trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py

**Module Path:** [`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:494)

**Original Line Number in Inventory:** 494

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose
The module implements a strategy pattern for determining the trustworthiness or confidence in a given forecast.
- It defines an abstract base class (ABC) `TrustScoringStrategy` which mandates a `score` method. This allows for different scoring algorithms to be implemented and used interchangeably.
- It provides a concrete implementation, `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy`, which calculates a confidence score based on several weighted factors:
    - **Baseline Confidence:** Derived from forecast fragility and capital movement in specific assets.
    - **Risk Score:** Calculated externally by `trust_system.trust_engine.compute_risk_score`.
    - **Historical Consistency:** Measures similarity of the current forecast's symbolic changes to recent past forecasts.
    - **Novelty Score:** Penalizes forecasts that are duplicates of recent past forecasts.
    - **Symbolic Drift Penalty:** Optionally applied based on configuration, calculated by `symbolic_system.symbolic_utils.compute_symbolic_drift_penalty`.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness
- The `TrustScoringStrategy` ABC is complete as an interface definition.
- The `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy` appears to be a fully implemented and operational scoring mechanism.
- There are no explicit `TODO` comments or `pass` statements in place of logic within the `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy`.
- The logic, while complex, seems self-contained for its defined purpose.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
- **Signs of intended extension:**
    - The primary purpose of the `TrustScoringStrategy` ABC is to allow for multiple scoring strategies. The \"Default\" naming of the concrete class strongly suggests that other, potentially more specialized or alternative, strategies are envisioned.
- **Implied but missing features/modules:**
    - Configuration for the hardcoded elements (asset list, weights, lookback window for memory) would make the default strategy more flexible.
    - No other strategy implementations are present in this specific file.
- **Indications of deviated/stopped development:**
    - No direct indications within this module. The current implementation seems to fulfill its role as a default strategy.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies
- **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    - `from trust_system.trust_engine import compute_risk_score` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:14`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:14))
    - `from core.pulse_config import CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD, USE_SYMBOLIC_OVERLAYS` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:15`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:15))
    - `from symbolic_system.symbolic_utils import compute_symbolic_drift_penalty` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:16`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:16))
- **External library dependencies:**
    - `abc.ABC`, `abc.abstractmethod` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:1`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:1)) (Python standard library)
    - `typing.Dict`, `typing.List`, `typing.Optional` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:2`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:2)) (Python standard library)
- **Interaction with other modules:**
    - Expected to be instantiated and used by components responsible for evaluating forecasts, likely within the `trust_system`.
    - Relies on `trust_engine` for risk score computation.
    - Relies on `symbolic_utils` for symbolic drift penalty.
    - Reads configuration from `core.pulse_config`.
    - Consumes `forecast` (Dict) and `memory` (List[Dict]) data structures, implying interaction with modules that produce or manage this data.
- **Input/output files:**
    - Does not directly read from or write to files. Operates on in-memory Python objects.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages
- **`TrustScoringStrategy` (Abstract Base Class):**
  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
  from typing import Dict, List, Optional

  class TrustScoringStrategy(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def score(self, forecast: Dict, memory: Optional[List[Dict]] = None) -> float:
          pass

  class MyAlternativeStrategy(TrustScoringStrategy):
      def score(self, forecast: Dict, memory: Optional[List[Dict]] = None) -> float:
          # Custom logic to score the forecast
          custom_score = 0.8 # Example
          return custom_score
  ```
- **`DefaultTrustScoringStrategy`:**
  ```python
  # Assuming DefaultTrustScoringStrategy and its dependencies are available
  # from trust_system.services.trust_scoring_strategy import DefaultTrustScoringStrategy

  strategy = DefaultTrustScoringStrategy()

  sample_forecast = {
      "forecast": {
          "start_capital": {"nvda": 1000, "msft": 1500, "ibit": 500, "spy": 2000},
          "end_capital": {"nvda": 1050, "msft": 1480, "ibit": 510, "spy": 2000},
          "symbolic_change": {"trend": 0.6, "volatility": 0.3}
      },
      "fragility": 0.05,
      # Other relevant keys expected by compute_risk_score and compute_symbolic_drift_penalty
  }

  sample_memory = [
      {"forecast": {"symbolic_change": {"trend": 0.5, "volatility": 0.25}}},
      {"forecast": {"symbolic_change": {"trend": 0.6, "volatility": 0.3}}}, # Duplicate
      {"forecast": {"symbolic_change": {"trend": 0.4, "volatility": 0.35}}}
  ]

  # Note: For this example to run, mocks or actual implementations for
  # compute_risk_score, CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD, USE_SYMBOLIC_OVERLAYS,
  # and compute_symbolic_drift_penalty would be needed.
  # confidence_score = strategy.score(sample_forecast, sample_memory)
  # print(f"Calculated confidence: {confidence_score}")
  # print(f"Risk score in forecast: {sample_forecast.get('risk_score')}")
  # print(f"Historical consistency in forecast: {sample_forecast.get('historical_consistency')}")
  ```
  The `score` method modifies the input `forecast` dictionary by adding `"risk_score"` and `"historical_consistency"` keys.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues
- **Asset List for Movement Score:** The list `["nvda", "msft", "ibit", "spy"]` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:27`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:27)) is hardcoded. This should ideally be configurable or dynamically determined.
- **Movement Score Divisor:** The value `1000.0` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:29`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:29)) used to normalize `delta_sum` is a magic number. Its rationale should be documented or it should be a configurable parameter.
- **Memory Lookback Window:** The use of `memory[-3:]` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:37`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:37), [`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:57`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:57)) for historical consistency and novelty checks hardcodes the lookback to the last 3 entries. This could be a configurable parameter.
- **Scoring Weights:** The weights `baseline_weight = 0.4`, `risk_weight = 0.3`, `historical_weight = 0.2`, `novelty_weight = 0.1` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:65-68`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:65-68)) are hardcoded. These are critical parameters that significantly influence the final score and should be configurable, potentially per forecast type or context.
- **Default Similarity:** `sim = 0.5` ([`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:46`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:46), [`trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:48`](trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py:48)) is used when symbolic changes are missing or have no common keys. The basis for this default value could be clarified or made configurable.

## 7. Coupling Points
- **Data Structure Dependency:** Highly dependent on the specific keys and structure of the `forecast` dictionary (e.g., `forecast["forecast"]`, `forecast["fragility"]`, `fcast["start_capital"]`, `fcast["symbolic_change"]`) and the `memory` list of dictionaries.
- **Internal Module Dependency:** Tightly coupled to:
    - `trust_system.trust_engine.compute_risk_score`
    - `core.pulse_config` (for `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `USE_SYMBOLIC_OVERLAYS`)
    - `symbolic_system.symbolic_utils.compute_symbolic_drift_penalty`
- **Side Effects:** The `score` method modifies the input `forecast` dictionary by adding `'risk_score'` and `'historical_consistency'` keys. Callers must be aware of this mutation.

## 8. Existing Tests
- A search for `tests/test_trust_scoring_strategy.py` yielded no results. This suggests that dedicated unit tests for this module, following this common naming pattern, may not exist or are located elsewhere/named differently. Comprehensive testing is crucial given the calculation-heavy nature and the number of configurable aspects (even if currently hardcoded).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow
- The module employs the **Strategy Design Pattern**, with `TrustScoringStrategy` as the abstract strategy and `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy` as a concrete strategy.
- **Flow of `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy.score()`:**
    1.  Extracts `fcast` (inner forecast data) and `fragility` from the input `forecast`.
    2.  Calculates `symbolic_penalty` based on `fragility`.
    3.  Calculates `movement_score` based on absolute changes in hardcoded asset values (`"nvda"`, `"msft"`, `"ibit"`, `"spy"`) between `start_capital` and `end_capital`.
    4.  Computes `baseline_confidence` as an average of `(1 - symbolic_penalty)` and `movement_score`.
    5.  Invokes `compute_risk_score(forecast, memory)` from `trust_engine` and stores the result in `forecast["risk_score"]`.
    6.  If `memory` is provided, calculates `historical_consistency`:
        - Iterates through the last 3 entries in `memory`.
        - Compares `symbolic_change` in the current `fcast` with `symbolic_change` in past forecasts.
        - Calculates similarity (`sim`) based on the sum of absolute differences of common keys. Defaults to 0.5 if no common keys or missing data.
        - Averages these similarities.
        - Stores the result in `forecast["historical_consistency"]`.
    7.  If `memory` is provided, calculates `novelty_score`:
        - Checks if the `symbolic_change` in the current `fcast` is identical to any in the last 3 entries of `memory`.
        - `novelty_score` is 0.0 if a duplicate is found, 1.0 otherwise.
    8.  Combines scores using hardcoded weights:
        `final_confidence = (baseline_weight * baseline_confidence) + (risk_weight * (1 - risk_score)) + (historical_weight * historical_consistency) + (novelty_weight * novelty_score)`.
    9.  If `USE_SYMBOLIC_OVERLAYS` (from `core.pulse_config`) is true, subtracts `compute_symbolic_drift_penalty(forecast)`.
    10. Ensures `final_confidence` is within `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (from `core.pulse_config`) and 1.0, then rounds to 3 decimal places.
    11. Returns `final_confidence`.

## 10. Naming Conventions
- **Classes:** `TrustScoringStrategy`, `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy` (PascalCase) - Standard.
- **Methods:** `score` (snake_case) - Standard.
- **Variables:** Generally snake_case (e.g., `symbolic_penalty`, `movement_score`, `historical_consistency`). `fcast` is a minor abbreviation.
- **Constants:** Imported constants (`CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `USE_SYMBOLIC_OVERLAYS`) are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE - Standard.
- Overall, naming is clear and follows Python conventions.
