# Module Analysis: `recursive_training.aws_batch_submit_status`

**File Path:** [`recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py)

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

This module is a command-line utility script designed to monitor the status of AWS Batch jobs, specifically those submitted for Pulse retrodiction training. It allows users to check the progress and outcome of jobs previously initiated, likely by a companion script such as [`aws_batch_submit.py`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit.py). Its primary functions include retrieving job details from AWS Batch, displaying them in a readable format, and optionally, continuously polling for updates until the job reaches a terminal state.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope. It includes:
*   Argument parsing for job ID, AWS region, and monitoring options.
*   AWS Batch client initialization.
*   Fetching and displaying detailed job status, including timestamps, reasons, and container information.
*   Continuous monitoring with a configurable polling interval.
*   Generation of direct links to CloudWatch logs for the job.
*   Basic error handling for AWS client creation and API calls.

No obvious TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete sections were identified within the script.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Enhanced Job Management:** The script is purely for status monitoring. It lacks features for job management like canceling, retrying, or listing multiple jobs.
*   **Advanced Error Handling:** While basic `ClientError` exceptions are caught, more specific error handling for different AWS Batch issues (e.g., throttling, invalid parameters before submission) could be beneficial.
*   **Output Formatting Options:** The output is currently text-based to `stdout`. Options for structured output (e.g., JSON) could be useful for integration with other tools.
*   **Configuration File:** AWS region and poll interval are managed via CLI arguments or environment variables. A configuration file might be useful for more complex setups, though perhaps overkill for this utility.
*   **Integration with a Centralized Logging/Monitoring System:** Beyond printing to `stdout` and providing CloudWatch links, it doesn't integrate with a more extensive project-wide logging or monitoring dashboard.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Internal Project Dependencies
*   Implicitly related to [`recursive_training.aws_batch_submit`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit.py) as it monitors jobs created by such a script.
*   No direct code imports from other modules within the `recursive_training` package or the broader project. It functions as a standalone script.

### External Library Dependencies
*   `os`: For environment variable access (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`, `AWS_REGION`).
*   `sys`: For command-line arguments (`sys.argv` implicitly via `argparse`) and `sys.exit`.
*   `time`: For `time.sleep` during polling and calculating runtime.
*   `logging`: For application-level logging.
*   `argparse`: For parsing command-line arguments.
*   `datetime` (from `datetime`): For formatting timestamps.
*   `boto3`: AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with the AWS Batch service.
*   `botocore.exceptions`: For handling `ClientError` from `boto3`.

### Data Interaction
*   **Input:**
    *   AWS Batch Job ID (via `--job-id` CLI argument).
    *   AWS Region (via `--aws-region` CLI argument or `AWS_REGION` environment variable).
    *   AWS credentials (implicitly handled by `boto3` through environment variables, shared credentials file, or IAM roles).
*   **Output:**
    *   Job status information printed to `stdout`.
    *   CloudWatch log URLs printed to `stdout` if requested.
*   **Shared State:** Interacts with the AWS Batch service, reading job state information managed by AWS.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **`parse_args()`**:
    ```python
    # Called internally by main()
    # Example CLI usage that invokes this:
    # python -m recursive_training.aws_batch_submit_status --job-id "abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890" --monitor
    args = parse_args()
    job_id = args.job_id
    ```
*   **`get_batch_client(region: str)`**:
    ```python
    # region = "us-west-2"
    # batch_client = get_batch_client(region)
    ```
    Creates a `boto3` client for the AWS Batch service.
*   **`get_job_status(batch_client: boto3.client, job_id: str)`**:
    ```python
    # job_details = get_job_status(batch_client, "abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890")
    # print(job_details['status'])
    ```
    Fetches current status and details for the given `job_id`.
*   **`display_job_status(job_info: Dict[str, Any], show_logs: bool = False)`**:
    ```python
    # job_details = get_job_status(batch_client, "my_job_id")
    # display_job_status(job_details, show_logs=True)
    ```
    Prints a formatted summary of the job information to the console.
*   **`monitor_job(batch_client: boto3.client, job_id: str, poll_interval: int = 30, show_logs: bool = False)`**:
    ```python
    # final_status = monitor_job(batch_client, "my_job_id", poll_interval=60, show_logs=True)
    # print(f"Job finished with status: {final_status['status']}")
    ```
    Continuously polls and displays job status until it completes or fails.
*   **`main()`**:
    The main entry point orchestrating the script's logic based on parsed arguments. Executed when the script is run.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default AWS Region:** `"us-east-1"` is used as a default in [`parse_args()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:43) and [`get_batch_client()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:56). This is configurable via the `--aws-region` CLI argument or the `AWS_REGION` environment variable, mitigating the rigidity of hardcoding.
*   **Default Poll Interval:** `30` seconds is the default in [`parse_args()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:49). Configurable via `--poll-interval`.
*   **Default Log Level:** `"INFO"` is used as a default for logging in [`logging.basicConfig()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:25). Configurable via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
*   **Logger Name:** `"aws_batch_status"` is hardcoded in [`recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:32`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:32). This is standard practice for module-specific loggers.
*   **Terminal Job States:** `['SUCCEEDED', 'FAILED']` are hardcoded lists in [`monitor_job()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:196) and [`main()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:230). These are standard AWS Batch terminal states and unlikely to change, making this acceptable.
*   **CloudWatch Log URL Format:** The URL structure `f"https://{region}.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region={region}#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/aws/batch/job/log-events/stream/{log_stream}"` ([`recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:176`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:176)) is specific to AWS. While standard, changes by AWS could break it. This is a common trade-off for deep-linking into provider consoles.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **AWS Batch Service:** The module is tightly coupled to the AWS Batch service API and its data structures (response from `describe_jobs`). Changes in the AWS Batch API could break this script.
*   **`boto3` Library:** Relies heavily on `boto3` for all AWS interactions.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Defines a specific CLI contract.
*   **Environment Variables:** Relies on `AWS_REGION` and `LOG_LEVEL` environment variables for default configuration.
*   **Implicitly with Job Submission:** Assumes jobs are submitted to AWS Batch in a way that they can be identified and described by their Job ID.

## 8. Existing Tests

Based on the file listing for `tests/recursive_training/`, there is **no dedicated test file** (e.g., `test_aws_batch_submit_status.py`) for this module. This indicates a gap in test coverage.

Potential tests could include:
*   Mocking `boto3.client` and `describe_jobs` calls to test:
    *   Status parsing for different job states (SUBMITTED, PENDING, RUNNABLE, STARTING, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED).
    *   Correct extraction of job details (name, timestamps, container info, reasons).
    *   Handling of missing job scenarios.
    *   Handling of `ClientError` from AWS.
*   Testing argument parsing logic in [`parse_args()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:34).
*   Testing the monitoring loop logic in [`monitor_job()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:181) (e.g., polling, termination conditions, `KeyboardInterrupt`).
*   Verifying the correct formatting of displayed status and CloudWatch URLs.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The script operates as a command-line application:
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Sets up basic logging ([`logging.basicConfig()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:24)).
    *   A logger instance `logger` is created ([`recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:32`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:32)).
2.  **Argument Parsing (`main()` -> `parse_args()`):**
    *   The [`main()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:218) function calls [`parse_args()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:34) to process CLI arguments (`--job-id`, `--aws-region`, `--monitor`, `--poll-interval`, `--show-logs`).
3.  **AWS Client Creation (`main()` -> `get_batch_client()`):**
    *   An AWS Batch client is instantiated using [`get_batch_client()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:56) with the specified or default region.
4.  **Job Status Retrieval (`main()` -> `get_job_status()` or `monitor_job()` -> `get_job_status()`):**
    *   The [`get_job_status()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:72) function is called to fetch the current details of the specified job ID using `batch_client.describe_jobs()`. It processes the response and returns a dictionary.
5.  **Status Display (`main()` -> `display_job_status()` or `monitor_job()` -> `display_job_status()`):**
    *   The [`display_job_status()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:118) function takes the job information dictionary and prints a formatted status report to `stdout`. This includes timestamps, runtime, and container details if available. If `show_logs` is true, it constructs and prints a CloudWatch log URL.
6.  **Monitoring Loop (if `--monitor` is active, `main()` -> `monitor_job()`):**
    *   If monitoring is enabled and the job is not yet in a terminal state (`SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`), [`monitor_job()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:181) is invoked.
    *   This function enters a loop:
        *   Calls [`get_job_status()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:72).
        *   Calls [`display_job_status()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:118).
        *   If the job status is terminal, the loop breaks.
        *   Otherwise, it waits for `poll_interval` seconds before repeating.
        *   The loop can be interrupted with `Ctrl+C`.
7.  **Termination:**
    *   The [`main()`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:218) function returns `0` on successful execution or `1` if an exception occurs. `sys.exit()` is called with this return code.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Modules:** `aws_batch_submit_status.py` - Descriptive and follows `snake_case`.
*   **Functions:** `snake_case` (e.g., [`get_batch_client`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:56), [`display_job_status`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:118)). Consistent with PEP 8.
*   **Variables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `job_id`, `batch_client`, `poll_interval`). Consistent with PEP 8.
*   **Constants:**
    *   `LOG_LEVEL` (environment variable name) and `AWS_REGION` (environment variable name) are implicitly `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
    *   `terminal_states` ([`recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:196`](../../recursive_training/aws_batch_submit_status.py:196)) is `snake_case` but used as a constant list of strings. Could be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for strictness but is clear in its current usage.
*   **Logging:** Logger name `aws_batch_status` is descriptive.
*   **No Classes:** The module is procedural and does not define any classes.

Overall, naming conventions are clear, consistent, and largely adhere to PEP 8 standards for Python code. No significant AI assumption errors or deviations were noted.
