# Module Analysis: `forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`cluster_memory_compressor.py`](forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py:1) is to reduce a batch of forecasts to only the top-ranked forecast per symbolic cluster. This module is specifically designed for long-term memory retention, digest distillation, and presenting optimized forecast views to operators. It implements a compression strategy that preserves the best representative forecast from each narrative cluster.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears fully operational and complete:

- Well-structured with clear docstrings and type annotations
- Contains fully implemented core functionality
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Contains a simple test case at the end
- Marked as version 1.0.0

There are no TODO comments, incomplete implementations, or placeholder functions that would indicate unfinished work.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

While functionally complete, there are potential areas for future enhancement:

- The scoring function (`score_forecast`) is quite simple, just combining alignment score and confidence. Future iterations might implement more sophisticated scoring algorithms that consider additional factors.
- The test block is minimal and has a commented-out line for the actual file export functionality, suggesting test coverage could be expanded.
- The module relies on an external `classify_forecast_cluster` function imported from `forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier`, which is a key dependency that might be enhanced in parallel.

## Connections & Dependencies

- **Standard Libraries:**
  - `json`: For serializing forecast data
  - `os`: For file operations
  - `logging`: For error and status reporting
  - `typing`: For type annotations (List, Dict)

- **Project Module Dependencies:**
  - `forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier`: Provides the `classify_forecast_cluster` function

- **Input/Output:**
  - Input: List of forecast dictionaries
  - Output: Compressed list of forecasts or JSONL file on disk

## Function and Class Example Usages

- **Score a forecast:**
  ```python
  from forecast_output.cluster_memory_compressor import score_forecast
  
  forecast = {"alignment_score": 0.8, "confidence": 0.7}
  score = score_forecast(forecast)  # Returns 1.5
  ```

- **Compress forecasts by cluster:**
  ```python
  from forecast_output.cluster_memory_compressor import compress_by_cluster
  
  forecasts = [
      {"id": 1, "alignment_score": 0.8, "confidence": 0.7},
      {"id": 2, "alignment_score": 0.9, "confidence": 0.6},
      {"id": 3, "alignment_score": 0.5, "confidence": 0.5},
  ]
  compressed = compress_by_cluster(forecasts)
  ```

- **Export compressed forecasts to disk:**
  ```python
  from forecast_output.cluster_memory_compressor import compress_by_cluster, export_cluster_memory
  
  forecasts = [...]  # Your forecast batch
  compressed = compress_by_cluster(forecasts)
  export_cluster_memory(compressed, "cluster_memory.jsonl")
  ```

## Hardcoding Issues

There are minimal hardcoded elements in the module:

- File extension validation for `.jsonl` files
- Use of `.tmp` suffix for temporary files during export
- UTF-8 encoding for file operations (which is a reasonable standard choice)

No problematic hardcoded values like paths, credentials, or magic numbers were identified.

## Coupling Points

- **Direct dependency** on `forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier.classify_forecast_cluster` for cluster classification
- **Expected structure** of forecast dictionaries with fields like `alignment_score` and `confidence`
- **File system operations** for saving compressed forecasts

## Existing Tests

The module includes a minimal test block at the end (lines 103-113) that:
- Creates a small set of test forecasts
- Calls `compress_by_cluster` to verify it runs without errors
- Prints the results for manual inspection
- Has a commented-out call to `export_cluster_memory`

There is no evidence of a separate test file specifically for this module, and the included test does not perform assertions or comprehensive validation. This suggests that test coverage could be improved.

## Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a simple, functional architecture:

1. **Scoring Function (`score_forecast`):** 
   - Evaluates forecast quality based on alignment score and confidence
   - Returns a single numeric score

2. **Compression Function (`compress_by_cluster`):**
   - Groups forecasts by narrative cluster
   - Selects the highest-scoring forecast from each cluster
   - Returns the compressed list of top forecasts

3. **Export Function (`export_cluster_memory`):**
   - Implements safe file writing with atomic replacement
   - Exports compressed forecasts to a JSONL file
   - Uses a temporary file during writing to prevent data corruption

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validation of input types
   - Comprehensive try/except blocks
   - Cleanup of temporary files on error

## Naming Conventions

The module follows consistent Python naming conventions:

- Function names use `snake_case`: `score_forecast`, `compress_by_cluster`, `export_cluster_memory`
- Variable names are descriptive and also use `snake_case`: `forecasts`, `cluster_map`, `compressed`
- Type annotations use PEP 484 style: `List[Dict]`, `Dict[str, List[Dict]]`
- The module filename is descriptive and matches its purpose: `cluster_memory_compressor.py`

The naming is consistent and adheres to standard Python conventions (PEP 8), making the code readable and maintainable.
# Module Analysis: `forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`cluster_memory_compressor.py`](forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py:1) is to reduce a batch of generated forecasts into a more manageable set by selecting only the top-ranked forecast for each identified symbolic cluster. This compressed output is intended for purposes such as long-term data retention, generating concise digests, and providing a simplified view for system operators.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears functionally complete for its core task of compressing forecasts based on clusters and a scoring mechanism. It includes functions for scoring, clustering-based selection, and exporting the results. There is a basic test block within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, indicating that the primary compression logic has been tested minimally.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Scoring Function Sophistication:** The `score_forecast` function is explicitly described as "Simple". This suggests it may be a placeholder or a basic implementation that could be enhanced with more complex scoring criteria in the future.
- **Clustering Logic:** The module relies on an external function, `classify_forecast_cluster`, for the actual clustering. The implementation and sophistication of the clustering mechanism are external dependencies and potential areas for future development or refinement.
- **Export Function Testing:** The test block does not include a call to `export_cluster_memory`, indicating this part of the functionality is not covered by the minimal included test.

## Connections & Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies:** Depends on `forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier` for classifying forecasts into clusters.
- **External Dependencies:** Uses standard Python libraries: `json`, `os`, `logging`, `typing`.
- **Interactions:** Takes a list of forecast dictionaries as input. Produces a compressed list of forecast dictionaries. Exports the compressed output to a `.jsonl` file, which is likely consumed by other modules for storage, reporting, or UI display.

## Function and Class Example Usages

- [`score_forecast(forecast: Dict)`](forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py:22): Calculates a score for a given forecast dictionary, currently based on the sum of `alignment_score` and `confidence` fields.
- [`compress_by_cluster(forecasts: List[Dict], scoring_fn=score_forecast)`](forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py:35): Takes a list of forecast dictionaries, groups them by the cluster assigned by `classify_forecast_cluster`, and returns the forecast with the highest score (determined by `scoring_fn`) from each group.
- [`export_cluster_memory(forecasts: List[Dict], path: str)`](forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py:71): Writes a list of compressed forecast dictionaries to a specified file path in JSON Lines format, using a temporary file for atomic writes.

## Hardcoding Issues

No significant hardcoded variables, secrets, or sensitive paths were identified. The `.jsonl` file extension is hardcoded for the output file format, which is appropriate for the module's function.

## Coupling Points

- **`forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier`:** Tightly coupled due to the reliance on this external function for core clustering logic.
- **Forecast Dictionary Structure:** Coupled with the expected structure of input forecast dictionaries, specifically the presence of `alignment_score` and `confidence` fields for scoring, and the need for information that `classify_forecast_cluster` can use for grouping.

## Existing Tests

A simple test block exists within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. This block only tests the `compress_by_cluster` function with a small, hardcoded list of forecasts. The `export_cluster_memory` function is not tested in this block. There is no corresponding dedicated test file (e.g., in the `tests/` directory) mentioned or visible in the environment details, suggesting limited overall test coverage for this module.

## Module Architecture and Flow

The module has a straightforward functional architecture. The primary flow involves:
1. Receiving a batch of forecasts.
2. Scoring each forecast (using `score_forecast`).
3. Classifying each forecast into a cluster (delegated to `classify_forecast_cluster`).
4. Grouping forecasts by their assigned cluster.
5. Selecting the highest-scoring forecast from each cluster.
6. Optionally exporting the selected forecasts to a file.

## Naming Conventions

Naming conventions for functions (`score_forecast`, `compress_by_cluster`, `export_cluster_memory`) and variables (`forecasts`, `cluster_map`, `compressed`) follow standard Python snake_case and appear consistent within the module. There are no classes defined in this module.
# Module Analysis: `forecast_output/cluster_memory_compressor.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of `cluster_memory_compressor.py` is to reduce a batch of forecasts to a single, representative forecast for each "symbolic cluster". This compressed output is intended for long-term retention, distillation into digests, and presentation in operator view. It aims to manage the volume of forecast data by keeping only the most relevant forecast per identified cluster.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears reasonably complete for its stated purpose. It defines functions for scoring forecasts, performing the compression by selecting the top forecast per cluster, and exporting the compressed memory to a file. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments within the code provided.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- The `score_forecast` function is described as "Simple scoring function". This suggests it might be a placeholder or a basic implementation that could be expanded or made more sophisticated in the future, potentially incorporating more factors than just `alignment_score` and `confidence`.
- The test block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) is minimal and the `export_cluster_memory` call is commented out, indicating the test coverage is likely incomplete and doesn't fully exercise the module's functionality, especially the file export part.

## Connections & Dependencies

- **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    - [`forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:1): Imports `classify_forecast_cluster`. This is a key dependency for grouping forecasts before compression.
- **External library dependencies:**
    - `json`: Used for serializing forecast dictionaries to JSON format for export.
    - `os`: Used for file operations, specifically replacing a temporary file with the final output file.
    - `logging`: Used for logging informational messages, warnings, and errors.
    - `typing`: Used for type hints (`List`, `Dict`).
- **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    - It processes a `List[Dict]` of forecasts, which are expected to have a `narrative_cluster` field (added by the module itself using the classifier) and fields like `alignment_score` and `confidence` for scoring.
- **Input/output files:**
    - **Input:** Expects a list of forecast dictionaries in memory.
    - **Output:** Writes compressed forecast data to a `.jsonl` file specified by the `path` argument in `export_cluster_memory`.

## Function and Class Example Usages

- `score_forecast(forecast: Dict) -> float`: Takes a forecast dictionary and returns a score based on `alignment_score` and `confidence`.
    ```python
    # Example usage (from test block)
    forecast = {"id": 1, "alignment_score": 0.8, "confidence": 0.7}
    score = score_forecast(forecast) # score would be 1.5
    ```
- `compress_by_cluster(forecasts: List[Dict], scoring_fn=score_forecast) -> List[Dict]`: Takes a list of forecast dictionaries, classifies them by cluster (using `classify_forecast_cluster`), and returns the highest-scoring forecast for each cluster.
    ```python
    # Example usage (from test block)
    test_forecasts = [
        {"id": 1, "alignment_score": 0.8, "confidence": 0.7},
        {"id": 2, "alignment_score": 0.9, "confidence": 0.6},
        {"id": 3, "alignment_score": 0.5, "confidence": 0.5},
    ]
    compressed = compress_by_cluster(test_forecasts)
    # compressed would contain the forecast with id 2 (score 1.5) if all were in the same cluster
    ```
- `export_cluster_memory(forecasts: List[Dict], path: str)`: Takes a list of compressed forecast dictionaries and writes them line by line as JSON objects to the specified file path.
    ```python
    # Example usage (commented out in test block)
    # export_cluster_memory(compressed, "test_cluster_memory.jsonl")
    ```

## Hardcoding Issues

- No significant hardcoded values were identified. The scoring function uses specific keys (`alignment_score`, `confidence`), but these appear to be expected fields in the forecast data structure rather than arbitrary hardcoded values.

## Coupling Points

- Tightly coupled with `forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier` as it directly imports and uses the `classify_forecast_cluster` function.
- Coupled with the expected structure of forecast dictionaries, requiring `alignment_score` and `confidence` fields for scoring.
- Coupled with the file system for exporting the compressed memory.

## Existing Tests

- A simple test block exists within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. It tests the `compress_by_cluster` function with a minimal list of forecasts.
- The test for `export_cluster_memory` is commented out.
- Based on the file listing in `environment_details`, there is a [`tests/test_digest_exporter.py`](tests/test_digest_exporter.py:1), but no specific test file named `test_cluster_memory_compressor.py` was listed, suggesting dedicated unit tests for this module might be missing or located elsewhere under a different naming convention. The existing test coverage appears minimal and insufficient.

## Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a simple procedural architecture with three main functions:
1.  `score_forecast`: A utility function to calculate a score for a single forecast.
2.  `compress_by_cluster`: The core logic function that iterates through forecasts, classifies them into clusters, groups them, and selects the top-scoring one from each group.
3.  `export_cluster_memory`: Handles writing the resulting list of top forecasts to a file.

The primary flow is expected to be: receive a batch of forecasts -> compress by cluster -> export to file.

## Naming Conventions

Naming conventions generally follow Python standards (snake_case for functions and variables). Class names are not applicable as there are no classes defined. Variable names like `forecasts`, `cluster_map`, `compressed`, `scoring_fn`, `path`, `tmp_path` are descriptive. No obvious AI assumption errors or deviations from PEP 8 were noted in the provided code snippet.
