# Module Analysis: `check_benchmark_deps.py`

**Module Path:** [`check_benchmark_deps.py`](../../../check_benchmark_deps.py:1)
**Located in:** `scripts/benchmarking/` (based on `docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md` listing, though the task states root directory, the script content and typical project structure suggest it's a utility script likely within a scripts or tools directory, specifically for benchmarking). The initial task stated root, but the file content and typical project structure for such a script, along with its name, imply it's related to the benchmarking process, likely residing in a path like `scripts/benchmarking/`. For this analysis, we'll assume its logical grouping is with benchmarking scripts.

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of this module is to verify that all necessary Python packages and internal project modules required for running the retrodiction benchmarking process are installed and available in the current environment. It checks for both "required" and "optional" dependencies. If required dependencies are missing, it exits with an error. If optional ones are missing, it prints a warning but allows proceeding with potentially reduced functionality.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be fully operational and complete for its defined purpose. It systematically checks a predefined list of dependencies and reports their status. There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `TODO`, `FIXME`) or incomplete logic sections within the script.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **No signs of being more extensive:** The module is focused and achieves its specific goal of dependency checking. There are no clear indications it was intended for broader responsibilities.
-   **Logical next steps:** The script itself is a prerequisite checker. The implied next step is to run the actual benchmark (e.g., `python benchmark_retrodiction.py`, as suggested by its output). No follow-up modules seem directly implied *from this script's code*, other than the benchmark script it supports.
-   **No deviations apparent:** Development seems to have followed a clear path to create a functional dependency checker.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:

The module attempts to import the following internal project modules, which are listed as dependencies for the benchmark:

-   [`recursive_training.parallel_trainer`](../../../recursive_training/parallel_trainer.py:1)
-   [`recursive_training.data.data_store`](../../../recursive_training/data/data_store.py:1)
-   [`recursive_training.metrics.metrics_store`](../../../recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py:1)
-   [`recursive_training.advanced_metrics.retrodiction_curriculum`](../../../recursive_training/advanced_metrics/retrodiction_curriculum.py:1)
-   [`core.optimized_trust_tracker`](../../../core/optimized_trust_tracker.py:1)
-   [`causal_model.optimized_discovery`](../../../causal_model/optimized_discovery.py:1)

These paths are consistent with modules found in the [`docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md`](../../../docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md:1).

### External Library Dependencies:

The module itself directly imports:
-   `importlib` (Python standard library)
-   `sys` (Python standard library)

It checks for the availability of the following external libraries:
-   **Required:**
    -   `cProfile` (Python standard library)
    -   `pstats` (Python standard library)
    -   `pandas`
    -   `numpy`
-   **Optional:**
    -   `psutil`

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:

-   The module does not directly interact with other modules via shared data files, databases, or message queues. Its purpose is to check if *other* modules (the benchmark scripts) *can* be run.

### Input/Output Files:

-   **Input:** None. The lists of dependencies are hardcoded within the script.
-   **Output:** Prints status messages to the standard output (console). It does not create or modify any files.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module is a script and is intended to be executed directly from the command line, for example:
```bash
python check_benchmark_deps.py
```
It does not define functions or classes intended for import and use by other modules.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Dependency Lists:** The lists `required_packages` and `optional_packages` (including their names and descriptions) are hardcoded. This is appropriate for this type of utility script, as these are the specific dependencies it's designed to check.
-   **Output Messages:** Status messages printed to the console are hardcoded strings. This is standard for such a script.
-   **Exit Code:** The script uses `sys.exit(1)` if required packages are missing, which is a standard practice.

No hardcoded paths, secrets, or sensitive environment variables were identified. The hardcoding present is functional and expected for a script of this nature.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   The module is coupled to the specific list of Python packages and internal project modules defined in `required_packages` and `optional_packages`. If the benchmark's dependencies change, this script must be updated accordingly.
-   It implicitly relies on the Python environment's `PYTHONPATH` being set up correctly so that `importlib.import_module()` can find both external packages and internal project modules.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   A specific test file (e.g., `tests/test_check_benchmark_deps.py` or `tests/scripts/benchmarking/test_check_benchmark_deps.py`) was not identified in the provided file listing from [`docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md`](../../../docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md:1).
-   Given its nature as a simple script that prints to stdout and exits, testing would likely involve running the script in different environments (with/without dependencies) and capturing its output and exit code.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a simple sequential flow:
1.  Define lists of required and optional packages with descriptions.
2.  Initialize empty lists to store missing packages.
3.  Print a message indicating the start of required package checks.
4.  Iterate through the `required_packages` list:
    a.  Attempt to import each package using `importlib.import_module()`.
    b.  Print success (✅) or failure (❌) status.
    c.  If import fails, add the package to `missing_required`.
5.  Print a message indicating the start of optional package checks.
6.  Iterate through the `optional_packages` list:
    a.  Attempt to import each package.
    b.  Print success (✅) or failure (⚠️ for missing optional) status.
    c.  If import fails, add the package to `missing_optional`.
7.  Evaluate results:
    a.  If `missing_required` is not empty, print an error message listing missing required packages and exit with status code 1.
    b.  Else if `missing_optional` is not empty, print a warning message listing missing optional packages and suggest how to run the benchmark with reduced functionality.
    c.  Else (all packages available), print a success message and suggest how to run the benchmark.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Variables:** `required_packages`, `optional_packages`, `missing_required`, `missing_optional`, `package`, `description`, `e` follow Python's `snake_case` convention and are descriptive.
-   **Module Name:** [`check_benchmark_deps.py`](../../../check_benchmark_deps.py:1) is descriptive of its function.
-   No classes or functions are defined for broader use.
-   The naming conventions are consistent and adhere to PEP 8. No obvious AI assumption errors or deviations were noted.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

-   **Specification:** The module has a clear and well-defined purpose (dependency checking) which it fulfills.
-   **Modularity:** It is a standalone script, highly modular in its function.
-   **Maintainability:** The code is simple, readable, and easy to maintain. Changes to dependencies would require editing the hardcoded lists, which is straightforward.
-   **Testability:** While no dedicated tests were found, the script's behavior is simple enough to be tested by checking stdout and exit codes under various dependency availability scenarios.
-   **No Hardcoding (Sensitive Data):** No sensitive data, secrets, or environment-specific paths are hardcoded. The hardcoding of dependency lists is functional for its purpose.
-   **Security:** No security concerns are apparent.
-   **Clarity & Simplicity:** The script is very clear and simple.

Overall, the module shows good adherence to SPARC principles relevant to a utility script of this nature. The primary area for potential improvement under SPARC would be adding formal automated tests if a higher degree of assurance is needed, though for such a simple utility, manual verification might suffice.
