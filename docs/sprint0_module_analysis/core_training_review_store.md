# Module Analysis: `core/training_review_store.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The [`core/training_review_store.py`](core/training_review_store.py:1) module is designed to manage the storage and retrieval of data submissions intended for training review. It supports two types of submissions: 'forecast' and 'retrodiction'. The core purpose is to provide a persistent, file-based storage mechanism for these submissions, allowing them to be reviewed, their status updated, and later used to improve model quality. It includes an in-memory index for quick access and listing of submissions.

Key functionalities include:
- Storing new training submissions (forecasts or retrodictions) as JSON files.
- Retrieving individual submissions by ID.
- Listing submissions with filtering (by status) and sorting options.
- Updating the status of submissions (e.g., 'pending_review', 'reviewed').
- Maintaining an in-memory index of submissions for performance, which can be refreshed from disk.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete for its defined scope. It implements all the key functionalities mentioned above.
- Directory creation for storage is handled.
- Submissions are saved as structured JSON.
- Timestamps and initial statuses are automatically added.
- Basic error handling and logging are present.
- An in-memory index ([`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28)) is maintained and refreshed.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Scalability of In-Memory Index:** The [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) loads metadata for all submissions of a type into memory. If the number of submissions becomes very large, this could lead to high memory consumption. The [`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239) function re-scans all files, which could also be slow with many files.
    - *Potential Mitigation:* Consider a more scalable indexing solution, perhaps a lightweight database (like SQLite) or a more optimized on-disk index if file counts grow excessively.
- **Data Validation:** There's no explicit validation of the `data` or `metadata` dictionaries beyond checking the `submission_type`. Invalid or unexpected structures within these dictionaries could cause issues later.
    - *Potential Mitigation:* Implement schema validation (e.g., using Pydantic) for `data` and `metadata`.
- **Concurrency:** File operations and updates to the shared [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) are not explicitly thread-safe. If multiple processes or threads access these functions concurrently, race conditions could occur.
    - *Potential Mitigation:* Implement file locking or use thread-safe data structures if concurrent access is anticipated.
- **Deletion of Submissions:** There is no function to delete a submission.
- **Archival/Lifecycle Management:** No mechanism for archiving or managing the lifecycle of old submissions.
- **Configuration of Storage Path:** The [`STORAGE_BASE_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:19) is hardcoded. Making this configurable (e.g., via environment variables or a config file) would improve flexibility.
- **More Granular Statuses:** The current status system is basic. More granular statuses or a workflow engine might be needed for a complex review process.
- **Security of File Paths:** While `submission_id` is used to create filenames, no sanitization is performed. A malicious `submission_id` containing path traversal characters (`../`) could potentially lead to writing files outside the intended directory if not handled carefully by the OS path functions (though `Path.joinpath` / `/` operator usually handles this well).

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Internal Pulse Modules:
- None directly imported or used beyond standard Python modules.

### External Libraries:
- `json`: Used for serializing and deserializing submission data to/from JSON files.
- `os`: (Implicitly via `Pathlib`) For path manipulations.
- `logging`: For application-level logging.
- `datetime` (from `datetime`): For generating timestamps.
- `pathlib` (specifically `Path`): For object-oriented file system path operations.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

```python
from core.training_review_store import (
    store_training_submission,
    get_training_submission,
    list_training_submissions,
    update_training_submission_status
)
import uuid

# --- Storing a new forecast submission ---
forecast_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
forecast_data = {"prediction": [1, 2, 3], "confidence": 0.8}
forecast_metadata = {"model_version": "v1.2", "user": "analyst_a"}

if store_training_submission('forecast', forecast_id, forecast_data, forecast_metadata):
    print(f"Forecast submission {forecast_id} stored successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to store forecast submission {forecast_id}.")

# --- Storing a new retrodiction submission ---
retro_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
retro_data = {"actuals": [0.9, 2.1, 2.8], "evaluation_metric": "MAE"}
retro_metadata = {"data_source": "source_x", "period": "2023-Q4"}

if store_training_submission('retrodiction', retro_id, retro_data, retro_metadata):
    print(f"Retrodiction submission {retro_id} stored successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to store retrodiction submission {retro_id}.")

# --- Retrieving a submission ---
retrieved_forecast = get_training_submission('forecast', forecast_id)
if retrieved_forecast:
    print(f"Retrieved forecast {forecast_id}: Status - {retrieved_forecast['status']}")
    # print(f"Data: {retrieved_forecast['data']}")
else:
    print(f"Forecast {forecast_id} not found.")

# --- Listing pending forecast submissions ---
print("\nPending forecast reviews:")
pending_forecasts = list_training_submissions('forecast', status='pending_review', limit=5)
for sub in pending_forecasts:
    print(f"  ID: {sub['id']}, Created: {sub['created_at']}, Status: {sub['status']}")

# --- Listing all retrodiction submissions (latest first) ---
print("\nAll retrodiction reviews (latest first):")
all_retrodictions = list_training_submissions('retrodiction', limit=5)
for sub in all_retrodictions:
    print(f"  ID: {sub['id']}, Created: {sub['created_at']}, Status: {sub['status']}")

# --- Updating submission status ---
if update_training_submission_status('forecast', forecast_id, 'reviewed', reviewer="reviewer_b", notes="Looks good, approved for training."):
    print(f"Forecast submission {forecast_id} status updated.")
    updated_submission = get_training_submission('forecast', forecast_id)
    if updated_submission:
        print(f"New status: {updated_submission['status']}")
        print(f"Reviewer: {updated_submission.get('review', {}).get('reviewer')}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to update status for forecast {forecast_id}.")

# --- Attempting to retrieve a non-existent submission ---
non_existent_id = "does-not-exist"
print(f"\nAttempting to retrieve non-existent submission: {non_existent_id}")
failed_retrieval = get_training_submission('forecast', non_existent_id)
if not failed_retrieval:
    print("Correctly returned None for non-existent submission.")

```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Storage Paths:** [`STORAGE_BASE_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:19), [`FORECAST_REVIEWS_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:20), and [`RETRODICTION_REVIEWS_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:21) are hardcoded relative to the current working directory (`./data/...`). This makes the storage location fixed and not easily configurable without code changes.
- **Submission Types:** The valid submission types (`'forecast'`, `'retrodiction'`) are hardcoded strings in multiple places. Using constants or an Enum could improve maintainability.
- **Default Status:** The initial status `'pending_review'` is hardcoded in [`store_training_submission()`](core/training_review_store.py:34).
- **Index Keys:** Keys used within the [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) entries (e.g., `'id'`, `'created_at'`, `'status'`, `'file_path'`) are hardcoded.
- **Sort Key Default:** The default `sort_by` key in [`list_training_submissions()`](core/training_review_store.py:141) defaults to `''` if the key is missing, which might not be the most robust default for sorting.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **File System:** The module is tightly coupled to the local file system for persistence. Changes to the storage mechanism (e.g., moving to a database or cloud storage) would require significant refactoring.
- **JSON Format:** Data is stored in JSON format. Any change to this format would impact reading old data.
- **Global Index:** The [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) is a global, module-level variable, creating a shared state.
- **Logging Configuration:** The module configures basic logging directly ([`logging.basicConfig`](core/training_review_store.py:15)). In a larger application, logging is typically configured centrally.

## 8. Existing Tests

The presence or nature of tests for this module cannot be determined from its source code alone.
Typical tests would involve:
- Storing various submissions and verifying file creation and content.
- Retrieving submissions and checking data integrity.
- Listing submissions with different filters and sort orders.
- Updating submission statuses and verifying changes in the file and index.
- Testing edge cases like invalid submission types, non-existent IDs.
- Testing the [`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239) functionality.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

- **Initialization:**
    - Defines base storage directories ([`STORAGE_BASE_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:19)) and subdirectories for forecasts and retrodictions.
    - Ensures these directories exist using [`Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`](core/training_review_store.py:24).
    - Initializes an empty in-memory dictionary [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) to cache submission metadata.
    - Calls [`_init()`](core/training_review_store.py:277) on module load, which in turn calls [`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239) for both 'forecast' and 'retrodiction' types to populate the index from any existing files on disk.
- **Storage ([`store_training_submission()`](core/training_review_store.py:34)):**
    - Validates `submission_type`.
    - Prepares a submission package (dictionary) including data, metadata, ID, status, and creation timestamp.
    - Determines the correct storage directory based on `submission_type`.
    - Writes the submission package to a JSON file named `{submission_id}.json`.
    - Updates the in-memory [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) with metadata for the new submission.
- **Retrieval ([`get_training_submission()`](core/training_review_store.py:92)):**
    - Validates `submission_type`.
    - Checks if the `submission_id` is in the [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28).
        - If not, it attempts to find the file on disk. If found, it loads the data, updates the index, and returns the data.
        - If in the index, it loads the submission from the `file_path` stored in the index.
    - Returns the full submission data (dictionary) or `None` if not found or an error occurs.
- **Listing ([`list_training_submissions()`](core/training_review_store.py:141)):**
    - Validates `submission_type`.
    - Calls [`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239) to ensure the index is up-to-date with files on disk.
    - Retrieves submission summaries from the [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28).
    - Optionally filters by `status`.
    - Sorts the results based on `sort_by` and `reverse` parameters.
    - Returns a list of submission summaries (dictionaries containing ID, creation date, status, file path), limited by `limit`.
- **Status Update ([`update_training_submission_status()`](core/training_review_store.py:181)):**
    - Validates `submission_type`.
    - Retrieves the full submission using [`get_training_submission()`](core/training_review_store.py:92).
    - Updates the `status` and adds/updates review information (reviewer, notes, timestamp) in the submission dictionary.
    - Overwrites the existing JSON file with the updated submission.
    - Updates the `status` in the in-memory [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28).
- **Index Refresh ([`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239)):**
    - Scans the appropriate storage directory for `*.json` files.
    - For each file not already in the [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28), it loads the JSON, extracts metadata (ID, created_at, status), and adds it to the index along with the file path.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Constants:** [`STORAGE_BASE_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:19), [`FORECAST_REVIEWS_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:20), [`RETRODICTION_REVIEWS_DIR`](core/training_review_store.py:21) use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is standard for constants.
- **Module-level variables:** [`_submissions_index`](core/training_review_store.py:28) uses a leading underscore, indicating it's intended for internal use.
- **Functions:** Function names like [`store_training_submission()`](core/training_review_store.py:34), [`get_training_submission()`](core/training_review_store.py:92) use `snake_case` and are descriptive.
- **Internal Functions:** [`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239), [`_init()`](core/training_review_store.py:277) use a leading underscore, correctly indicating they are for internal module use.
- **Variables:** Local variables generally follow `snake_case`.
- **Logging:** `logger` is a standard name for a logger instance.

Naming conventions are clear, idiomatic Python, and contribute to readability.

## 11. Overall Assessment of Completeness and Quality

- **Completeness:** The module is reasonably complete for its core task of storing, retrieving, listing, and updating training review submissions in a file-based system. It covers the essential CRUD-like operations for these submissions.
- **Quality:**
    - **Clarity & Simplicity:** The code is generally clear and well-structured. The separation of concerns into different functions is logical. Docstrings are present and explain the purpose of functions and their parameters.
    - **Maintainability:** The module is of moderate size and complexity. The use of `pathlib` and clear function definitions aids maintainability. Hardcoded paths and string literals for types/statuses could be slightly improved.
    - **Correctness:** The logic for file operations, JSON handling, and index management appears correct for the described functionality.
    - **Robustness:** Basic error handling (try-except blocks) is present for file operations and other potential issues. Logging provides insights into operations and errors. The `exist_ok=True` in `mkdir` is good for idempotency. The index refresh mechanism helps in case the in-memory index gets out of sync.
    - **Efficiency:** For a small to moderate number of submissions, the performance should be acceptable. The in-memory index helps speed up listing and retrieval after initial load/refresh. For very large numbers of files, the full directory scan in [`_refresh_index()`](core/training_review_store.py:239) and loading all metadata into memory could become bottlenecks.
    - **Testability:** The functions are generally testable, especially if file system operations are mocked.

Overall, [`core/training_review_store.py`](core/training_review_store.py:1) is a functional and well-organized module for managing training review data. It addresses its primary requirements effectively. The main areas for future improvement would be around scalability for very large datasets and configurability of storage.
