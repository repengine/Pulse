# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of this module is to suggest symbolic tuning recommendations for forecasts that are flagged as unstable or exhibiting drift. It aims to provide actionable plans for revising symbolic elements like overlay profiles, arc labels, and symbolic tags to improve forecast stability.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operational for its defined scope. It contains functions to:
- Plan a revision for a single forecast ([`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:18)).
- Determine if a forecast is ready for revision ([`revision_ready()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:51)).
- Generate a report of revision plans for multiple forecasts ([`generate_revision_report()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:64)).
- Plan revisions specifically for fragmented arcs ([`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:86)).

There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass`, `NotImplementedError`) or "TODO" comments within the core logic. A basic test function [`_test_revision_planner()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:112) is included.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Limited Scope of Revisions:** The revision logic in [`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:18) is based on a few specific hardcoded conditions (e.g., `if arc in {"collapse risk", "despair drop", "fatigue loop"}`). This could be expanded to handle a wider variety of scenarios or use a more dynamic/configurable rule set.
*   **Granularity of Overlay Adjustments:** Suggestions for overlay adjustments are qualitative (e.g., `"reduce to < 0.5"`). A more sophisticated approach might suggest specific numerical adjustments based on the current value and the degree of instability.
*   **No Learning/Adaptation:** The revision rules are static. There's no indication of a mechanism for these rules to be learned, adapted, or updated based on the effectiveness of past revisions.
*   **Integration with a Broader System:** While it plans revisions, the module doesn't handle the application or tracking of these revisions. This would likely be part of a larger symbolic tuning or system optimization loop.
*   **"symbolic_revision_needed" Flag:** The [`revision_ready()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:51) function relies on a `symbolic_revision_needed` boolean flag within the forecast dictionary. The logic for setting this flag (i.e., how instability or drift is detected and flagged) resides outside this module.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet. It's a self-contained module in terms of Python imports from within the project.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `typing` (standard library): For type hinting (`Dict`, `List`, `Any`).
    *   `collections.Counter` (standard library): Used in [`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:86) to count arc labels.
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   The module consumes `forecast` dictionaries as input. These dictionaries are expected to be produced by other parts of the Pulse system (e.g., a forecasting engine, a drift detection module).
    *   The keys expected within the `forecast` dictionary include: `"arc_label"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, `"forecast"`, `"symbolic_change"`, `"overlays"`, `"symbolic_revision_needed"`, `"trace_id"`, and `"symbolic_fragmented"`.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** None directly. It operates on in-memory Python dictionaries.
    *   **Output:** None directly to files. It returns Python dictionaries and lists of dictionaries containing revision plans.

    # ]
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

The module contains several hardcoded strings and thresholds that define its revision logic:

*   **Arc Labels for Re-labeling ([`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:34)):**
    *   `"collapse risk"`, `"despair drop"`, `"fatigue loop"` are hardcoded to be re-labeled to `"Stabilization Phase"`.
*   **Symbolic Tags for Adjustment ([`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:38)):**
    *   `"rage rise"`, `"despair"` are hardcoded to be adjusted to `"Neutralization"`.
*   **Overlay Names and Thresholds for Damping ([`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:42-46)):**
    *   Overlay `"rage"`: threshold `0.6`, suggested adjustment `"reduce to < 0.5"`.
    *   Overlay `"hope"`: threshold `0.2`, suggested adjustment `"increase to > 0.3"`.
*   **Arc Labels for Fragmented Revisions ([`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:102-106)):**
    *   `"Collapse Risk"`, `"Fatigue Loop"`: suggest tag `"Stabilization"`, overlay hints `{"hope": "increase", "rage": "reduce"}`.
    *   `"Despair Drop"`: suggest tag `"Reconstruction"`.
*   **Default/Unknown Values:**
    *   `"unknown"` as default for `trace_id` in [`generate_revision_report()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:80).
    *   `"unknown"` as default for `arc_label` in [`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:97).

These hardcoded values make the module rigid. If the symbolic vocabulary (arc labels, tags, overlay names) changes, or if the thresholds for revision need tuning, the code itself must be modified. Consider externalizing these to a configuration file or a more dynamic rule engine.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Input Data Structure:** Tightly coupled to the specific structure and keys of the `forecast` dictionary. Changes to this data structure in other parts of the system would break this module.
*   **Symbolic Vocabulary:** As noted in Hardcoding Issues, the module is coupled to specific symbolic names (e.g., "collapse risk", "rage").
*   **External Flagging:** Relies on an external process to set the `"symbolic_revision_needed"` and `"symbolic_fragmented"` flags in the forecast data. This module doesn't determine *why* a revision is needed, only *what* revision to suggest if flagged.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   A single, basic test function [`_test_revision_planner()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:112) is present within the module itself, executed when the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
*   This test specifically covers the [`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:86) function with a small, hardcoded dataset.
*   It uses `assert` to check for a basic condition and prints a success message.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   No tests for [`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:18), [`revision_ready()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:51), or [`generate_revision_report()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:64).
    *   The existing test for [`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:86) is not comprehensive (e.g., doesn't check all outputs or edge cases).
    *   No formal test suite structure (e.g., using `pytest` in a separate `tests/` directory) is apparent from this module alone. The file list shows `tests/symbolic_system/` but no specific test file for this module. A file like `tests/symbolic_system/test_pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py` would be expected.
    *   The test relies on `print` for feedback rather than standard test framework reporting.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module consists of a set of stateless utility functions. There are no classes or persistent state managed within this module.
*   **Control Flow:**
    1.  **Single Forecast Revision ([`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:18)):**
        *   Takes a forecast dictionary.
        *   Extracts `arc_label`, `symbolic_tag`, and `overlays`.
        *   Applies a series of `if` conditions based on hardcoded values of these extracted fields.
        *   Builds a `plan` dictionary with suggested changes.
        *   Returns the `plan`.
    2.  **Revision Readiness Check ([`revision_ready()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:51)):**
        *   Checks the boolean value of `"symbolic_revision_needed"` in the forecast.
    3.  **Batch Revision Report ([`generate_revision_report()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:64)):**
        *   Iterates through a list of forecasts.
        *   For each forecast, calls [`revision_ready()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:51).
        *   If ready, calls [`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:18).
        *   If a plan is generated, appends it (with `trace_id`) to a report list.
        *   Returns the report.
    4.  **Fragmented Arcs Revision ([`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:86)):**
        *   Filters forecasts for those with `"symbolic_fragmented": True`.
        *   Counts occurrences of `arc_label` in fragmented forecasts using `collections.Counter`.
        *   Iterates through unique arcs and their counts.
        *   Applies `if/elif` conditions based on hardcoded arc names to suggest tags and overlay hints.
        *   Appends these suggestions to a list of plans.
        *   Returns the list of plans.
*   **Data Flow:** Data primarily flows as dictionaries representing forecasts and revision plans. Functions transform input forecast data into output plan data.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Generally follow PEP 8 (snake_case, lowercase): [`plan_symbolic_revision`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:18), [`revision_ready`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:51), [`generate_revision_report`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:64), [`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:86), [`_test_revision_planner`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:112). The leading underscore in `_test_revision_planner` appropriately suggests it's an internal/utility test.
*   **Variables:** Mostly snake_case and descriptive (e.g., `arc_label`, `symbolic_tag`, `forecasts`, `arc_counts`). `fc` is used as a loop variable for forecast, which is a common abbreviation.
*   **Strings (Symbolic Vocabulary):**
    *   Arc labels like `"collapse risk"`, `"Stabilization Phase"` use a mix of lowercase and title case. In [`plan_revisions_for_fragmented_arcs()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:102), `"Collapse Risk"` and `"Fatigue Loop"` are title-cased, while in [`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:34) they are lowercase (`"collapse risk"`). This inconsistency could lead to errors if case sensitivity is not handled carefully (though Python's `.lower()` is used in [`plan_symbolic_revision()`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:29-30) for input processing).
    *   Symbolic tags like `"rage rise"`, `"Neutralization"` also mix cases.
    *   Overlay names like `"rage"`, `"hope"` are lowercase.
*   **Module Name:** `pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py` is consistent with PEP 8.
*   **Potential AI Assumption Errors/Deviations:** The inconsistency in casing for symbolic terms (e.g., "Collapse Risk" vs. "collapse risk") might be an area where AI-generated code or assumptions could introduce subtle bugs if not handled consistently. The current code uses `.lower()` for some inputs, which mitigates this for those specific cases.
