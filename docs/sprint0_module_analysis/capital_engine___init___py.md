# Analysis of capital_engine/__init__.py

## Module Intent/Purpose
The file `capital_engine/__init__.py` serves to mark the `capital_engine` directory as a Python package. This allows modules within the `capital_engine` directory (e.g., `capital_layer.py`, `capital_digest_formatter.py`) to be imported using the `capital_engine.` namespace (e.g., `from capital_engine import capital_layer`).

## Operational Status/Completeness
The module is complete for its primary purpose. An `__init__.py` file can be empty and still fulfill its role in package definition.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
- **Package-Level Imports:** Could be used to make key classes/functions from submodules directly available at the package level.
- **Package-Level Documentation:** A docstring could be added.
- **Package-Level Variables/Constants:** Could define package-wide configurations here.

## Connections & Dependencies
- None within this file itself. Enables imports from the `capital_engine` package.

## Function and Class Example Usages
Not applicable (empty file).

## Hardcoding Issues
Not applicable (empty file).

## Coupling Points
Creates a coupling point for modules importing from `capital_engine`.

## Existing Tests
Typically not directly tested. Functionality tested via modules within the package.

## Module Architecture and Flow
Not applicable (empty file). Structural role in Python's import system.

## Naming Conventions
Filename `__init__.py` is standard Python.
