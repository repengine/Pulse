# Module Analysis: `memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:) module is to track the symbolic lineage and mutations of forecasts across different versions. It provides utilities to reconstruct "memory chains" (sequences of related forecasts), identify repair ancestry, and trace paths of symbolic changes (flips). This is crucial for understanding how forecasts evolve, how they are corrected, and the stability of their symbolic representations over time.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its defined scope. It contains a set of focused functions that address different aspects of lineage tracing and comparison. There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass` statements in critical logic) or "TODO" comments within the provided code, suggesting that the implemented features are considered finished.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Handling of Branching Lineage:** The [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48) function currently reconstructs a linear chain by taking the first child if multiple exist (`lineage = fc.get("lineage", {}).get("children", []); current_id = lineage[0] if lineage else None`). This implies that if a forecast has multiple children (branching evolution), the current implementation only traces one path. Future enhancements might involve supporting the exploration of all branches or specific branching logic.
*   **Configurable Comparison Fields:** The [`compare_forecast_versions()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30) function uses a hardcoded list of fields for comparison: `["symbolic_tag", "arc_label", "confidence", "alignment_score", "license_status"]`. If the set of relevant symbolic metadata fields evolves, this list would need manual updates. A more flexible approach might involve passing the fields to compare as an argument or using a configuration mechanism.
*   **Advanced Drift Analysis:** While [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70) provides basic "tag_flips" and "arc_flips", more sophisticated drift analysis (e.g., types of flips, severity, impact on confidence) could be a logical next step if required.

There are no strong indications that development started on a significantly more extensive path and then deviated or stopped short for the core implemented features. The module seems to fulfill its specific utility role.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None. The module is self-contained in terms of project-specific Python imports.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `json`: Standard Python library, likely for potential future use if forecast objects were to be serialized/deserialized directly by this module, though not used in the current functions.
    *   `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`: Standard Python library for type hinting.
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   The module heavily relies on a specific dictionary structure for "forecast" objects. It expects keys such as:
        *   `"trace_id"`
        *   `"lineage"` (dictionary containing `"ancestors"` and `"children"` lists of trace IDs)
        *   `"symbolic_tag"`
        *   `"arc_label"`
        *   `"confidence"`
        *   `"alignment_score"`
        *   `"license_status"`
    *   This implies that other modules in the system are responsible for generating, storing, and retrieving these forecast objects with this defined schema. This module acts as a consumer and processor of this data structure.
*   **Input/Output Files:** The module itself does not directly read from or write to any files (logs, data files, metadata). It operates on in-memory Python dictionaries and lists passed as arguments.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module consists of functions. Assuming `forecast_data` is a list of forecast dictionaries and `sample_forecast_a` and `sample_forecast_b` are individual forecast dictionaries adhering to the expected structure:

*   **`trace_forecast_lineage(forecast: Dict) -> List[str]`**
    *   **Usage:** To get a list of ancestor trace IDs for a given forecast.
    *   **Example:** `ancestor_ids = forecast_episode_tracer.trace_forecast_lineage(sample_forecast_a)`

*   **`compare_forecast_versions(a: Dict, b: Dict) -> Dict`**
    *   **Usage:** To find differences in key symbolic metadata between two forecast versions.
    *   **Example:** `differences = forecast_episode_tracer.compare_forecast_versions(sample_forecast_a, sample_forecast_b)`
    *   `differences` would be a dictionary like `{'symbolic_tag': {'before': 'tag1', 'after': 'tag2'}}`.

*   **`build_episode_chain(forecasts: List[Dict], root_id: str) -> List[Dict]`**
    *   **Usage:** To reconstruct the sequence of forecasts that evolved from a specific root forecast.
    *   **Example:** `episode = forecast_episode_tracer.build_episode_chain(all_forecast_data, "initial_forecast_id_123")`

*   **`summarize_lineage_drift(chain: List[Dict]) -> Dict`**
    *   **Usage:** To analyze how much symbolic tags and arc labels changed across a reconstructed episode chain.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        episode_chain = forecast_episode_tracer.build_episode_chain(all_forecast_data, "root_id_abc")
        drift_summary = forecast_episode_tracer.summarize_lineage_drift(episode_chain)
        # drift_summary might be: {'total_versions': 5, 'tag_flips': 1, 'arc_flips': 2, 'symbolic_stability_score': 0.25}
        ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Comparison Fields:** As mentioned in Section 3, the list of fields (`fields = ["symbolic_tag", "arc_label", "confidence", "alignment_score", "license_status"]`) in [`compare_forecast_versions()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30) is hardcoded. This limits flexibility if the set of fields to compare needs to change without code modification.
*   **Stability Score Denominator:** In [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70), the denominator for `symbolic_stability_score` uses `max(total - 1, 1)`. While this handles the case of a single forecast in the chain (preventing division by zero), the choice of `1` as the minimum denominator is a hardcoded assumption.
*   **No other obvious hardcoded paths, secrets, or critical magic numbers/strings were identified.**

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Forecast Data Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the specific structure and expected keys of the forecast dictionary objects (e.g., `lineage`, `ancestors`, `children`, `trace_id`, `symbolic_tag`). Any changes to this data structure in other parts of the system (producer modules) would likely require corresponding changes in this tracer module to maintain compatibility. This is the most significant coupling point.
*   **Implicit Schema:** The functions implicitly define a schema for forecast metadata.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   A dedicated test file specifically named `test_forecast_episode_tracer.py` was **not found** in the `tests/` directory or the `tests/memory/` subdirectory.
*   The file [`tests/test_pulse_forecast_lineage.py`](tests/test_pulse_forecast_lineage.py:) exists in the `tests/` directory. While its exact contents were not examined as part of this specific module analysis, its name suggests it might contain tests relevant to forecast lineage, potentially covering some functionality provided by or similar to this tracer module.
*   **Conclusion:** There appears to be a gap in direct, dedicated unit tests for the `memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py` module itself. Functionality might be indirectly tested elsewhere, but specific unit tests would be beneficial.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module is a collection of stateless utility functions. It does not define any classes or maintain internal state between function calls.
*   **Key Components:** The four public functions:
    *   [`trace_forecast_lineage()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17)
    *   [`compare_forecast_versions()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30)
    *   [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48)
    *   [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70)
*   **Primary Data/Control Flows:**
    1.  **Input:** Functions take one or more forecast dictionaries, or a list of forecast dictionaries, and sometimes a specific `root_id` string.
    2.  **Processing:**
        *   Access specific keys within the input dictionaries (e.g., `lineage`, `symbolic_tag`).
        *   Iterate through lists of forecasts or through chains of ancestry/descendancy.
        *   Compare field values between forecast objects.
        *   Calculate summary statistics (e.g., number of flips, stability score).
    3.  **Output:** Functions return lists of strings (trace IDs), dictionaries (comparison diffs or drift summaries), or lists of forecast dictionaries (ordered chain).

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Use `snake_case` (e.g., [`trace_forecast_lineage()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17), [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48)), which is consistent with PEP 8.
*   **Variables:** Use `snake_case` (e.g., `root_id`, `tag_flips`, `current_id`).
*   **Clarity:** Names are generally descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of the functions and variables (e.g., `ancestors`, `diffs`, `symbolic_stability_score`).
*   **Module Name:** `forecast_episode_tracer.py` is descriptive.
*   **Author:** The module header indicates "Author: Pulse AI Engine".
*   **Consistency:** Naming conventions appear consistent within the module. No significant deviations from PEP 8 or obvious AI assumption errors in naming were observed.
