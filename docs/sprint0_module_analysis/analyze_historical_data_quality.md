# SPARC Analysis: analyze_historical_data_quality.py

**Date of Analysis:** 2025-05-14
**Analyzer:** Roo

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (Specification)

The [`analyze_historical_data_quality.py`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:1) module is a script designed to analyze the quality of historical timeline data, specifically for its suitability in retrodiction training. Its primary responsibilities, as outlined in its docstring ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:1-8`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:1-8)), include:
- Evaluating data completeness for a predefined list of priority variables.
- Verifying that the historical data depth meets minimum (e.g., 3 years) and target (e.g., 5 years) thresholds.
- Checking for missing values within the data.
- Analyzing temporal alignment across different variables.
- Generating a summary HTML report with visualizations detailing these quality aspects.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely operational and complete for its stated purpose. It defines a clear workflow: load data, analyze individual variables, analyze temporal alignment, generate plots, and then compile an HTML report.
- **Placeholders/TODOs:** No explicit "TODO" or "FIXME" comments were found in the code. The functionality described in the module's main docstring seems to be implemented.
- **Completeness:** The script can execute from start to finish, producing logs and an HTML report with embedded images.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Advanced Statistical Analysis:** The current analysis is based on counts, date ranges, and completeness percentages. More sophisticated statistical tests for data quality (e.g., stationarity tests, outlier detection methods beyond simple min/max, distribution analysis) are not implemented.
- **Imputation Effectiveness Analysis:** While the module docstring mentions "imputation effectiveness" ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:5`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:5)) as an analysis point, the actual code primarily checks for the presence and count of missing values ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:150`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:150), [`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:157-159`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:157-159)) rather than evaluating how effective any prior imputation steps might have been.
- **Configurability of Analysis Parameters:** Thresholds for "good," "warning," and "bad" data quality in the report (e.g., percentage for meeting year targets, completeness percentages for color-coding) are implicitly set in the report generation logic rather than being configurable.
- **Integration with Automated Pipelines:** The script is standalone. There's no indication of direct integration into a larger automated data validation or CI/CD pipeline.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports:
- **Project Modules:** None. This script is self-contained in terms of Python module imports from the project.
- **External Libraries:**
    - `os` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:10`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:10))
    - `json` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:11`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:11))
    - `numpy` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:12`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:12))
    - `pandas` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:13`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:13))

    - `typing.Dict, List, Any, Optional` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:18`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:18))

### Interactions:
- **Shared Data (Files):**
    - Reads variable transformation data from JSON files located in subdirectories under [`HISTORICAL_TIMELINE_DIR`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:32) (e.g., `data/historical_timeline/<variable_name>/transformations/*_transform_result.json`). The specific function is [`get_latest_transformation()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:78) and [`load_transformation_data()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:100).
    - Reads [`VARIABLE_CATALOG_PATH`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:33) (e.g., `data/historical_timeline/variable_catalog.json`) via [`load_variable_catalog()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:68).
    - Reads [`VERIFICATION_REPORT_PATH`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:34) (e.g., `data/historical_timeline/verification_report.json`) via [`load_verification_report()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:73).
- **Databases/Queues:** No direct interaction.

### Input/Output Files:
- **Input Files:**
    - [`data/historical_timeline/variable_catalog.json`](data/historical_timeline/variable_catalog.json)
    - [`data/historical_timeline/verification_report.json`](data/historical_timeline/verification_report.json)
    - `data/historical_timeline/<variable_name>/transformations/*_transform_result.json` (multiple files, one per variable)
- **Output Files:**
    - Log file: [`historical_data_analysis.log`](historical_data_analysis.log) (defined in [`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:25`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:25))
    - HTML Report: `data/historical_timeline/reports/historical_data_quality_report_<timestamp>.html` (generated by [`generate_report()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:298))
    - PNG Visualizations (embedded in the HTML report and saved to disk):
        - `data/historical_timeline/reports/historical_depth.png`
        - `data/historical_timeline/reports/data_completeness.png`
        - `data/historical_timeline/reports/summary_metrics.png`
        (all generated by [`generate_visualizations()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:193))

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module is primarily executed via its [`main()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:435) function.

- **`main()`**:
  Orchestrates the entire analysis process:
  1. Iterates through `PRIORITY_VARIABLES`.
  2. For each variable, calls [`analyze_variable_data()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:109) to get statistics like historical years, completeness, etc.
  3. Calls [`analyze_temporal_alignment()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:171) to get aggregate statistics across all analyzed variables.
  4. Calls [`generate_visualizations()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:193) to create plots of historical depth, completeness, and summary metrics.
  5. Calls [`generate_report()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:298) to compile all findings into an HTML document.

- **`analyze_variable_data(variable_name: str)`**:
  Loads the latest transformed data for a given `variable_name`, calculates metrics like date range, number of data points, missing value counts, and completeness percentage. Returns a dictionary of these metrics.

- **`get_latest_transformation(variable_name: str)`**:
  Locates the most recent `*_transform_result.json` file for a given variable within its `transformations` subdirectory.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

- **Directory Paths:**
    - [`HISTORICAL_TIMELINE_DIR = "data/historical_timeline"`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:32)
    - Paths derived from it: [`VARIABLE_CATALOG_PATH`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:33), [`VERIFICATION_REPORT_PATH`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:34), [`OUTPUT_DIR`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:35).
    - Transformation subdirectory path construction: `f"{HISTORICAL_TIMELINE_DIR}/{variable_name}/transformations"` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:80`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:80)).
    **Recommendation:** These paths could be made configurable, e.g., via command-line arguments or a configuration file, especially if the script needs to run in different environments or on different datasets.
- **Analysis Parameters:**
    - [`MIN_YEARS = 3`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:36)
    - [`TARGET_YEARS = 5`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:37)
    **Recommendation:** Make these configurable.
- **Priority Variables List:**
    - [`PRIORITY_VARIABLES`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:40-66) is a hardcoded list of financial and economic indicators.
    **Recommendation:** Allow this list to be loaded from an external file (e.g., JSON, CSV) or passed as an argument for flexibility.
- **Log File Name:**
    - `"historical_data_analysis.log"` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:25`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:25)) is hardcoded.
- **File Patterns:**
    - `f"*_transform_result.json"` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:88`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:88)) for transformation files.
- **Report Styling and Structure:**
    - The HTML structure and CSS styles are hardcoded within the [`generate_report()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:298) function ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:311-427`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:311-427)).
    **Recommendation:** Use a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2) for more maintainable HTML generation.
- **Visualization Thresholds:**
    - Lines for 95% and 99% completeness in `generate_visualizations` ([`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:242`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:242), [`analyze_historical_data_quality.py:245`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:245)).
    **Recommendation:** Make these configurable.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **File System Structure:** The script is tightly coupled to a specific directory structure under `data/historical_timeline/` for inputs and outputs. Changes to this structure would require code modifications.
- **Data File Formats:** Assumes specific JSON structures for `variable_catalog.json`, `verification_report.json`, and the `*_transform_result.json` files.
- **`PRIORITY_VARIABLES` List:** The script's core loop depends on this hardcoded list. If the set of variables to analyze changes, the script must be edited.
- **Matplotlib for Visualizations:** Directly uses Matplotlib for plotting. While standard, alternative visualization libraries or methods would require significant changes.
- **Pandas for Data Handling:** Relies on Pandas DataFrames for internal data manipulation.

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

- **Test Coverage:** No dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/test_analyze_historical_data_quality.py`) was found in the provided file list or implied by the project structure in `docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md`. The script appears to lack automated unit or integration tests.
- **Test Quality Gaps (Assumed):**
    - **File I/O:** Testing interactions with the file system (reading various JSONs, writing reports and images) would require mocking or setting up test file structures.
    - **Data Scenarios:** Testing with empty data files, malformed JSON, variables with no data, data with all missing values, data with varying completeness and historical depth.
    - **Error Handling:** Verify that `try-except` blocks correctly catch and log errors without crashing the script.
    - **Report Generation:** Validating the content and structure of the generated HTML report.
    - **Visualization Logic:** Testing the logic that prepares data for Matplotlib, though visual output itself is harder to unit test.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

- **Structure:** The module is a single Python script with a `main()` entry point and several helper functions, each responsible for a distinct part of the analysis (data loading, per-variable analysis, temporal alignment, visualization, report generation).
- **Flow:**
    1. Setup logging.
    2. `main()` function is called.
    3. It iterates through `PRIORITY_VARIABLES`.
    4. For each variable:
        - [`get_latest_transformation()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:78) finds the relevant data file.
        - [`load_transformation_data()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:100) loads it.
        - [`analyze_variable_data()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:109) processes it into statistics.
    5. [`analyze_temporal_alignment()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:171) aggregates statistics across variables.
    6. [`generate_visualizations()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:193) creates PNG plots.
    7. [`generate_report()`](analyze_historical_data_quality.py:298) compiles an HTML report embedding these plots and tables.
    8. Logs information and errors throughout the process.
- **Modularity:** Functions are relatively well-defined for their specific tasks. However, as a script, it's not designed for easy import and reuse of individual functions in other modules without refactoring.
- **Error Handling:** Uses `try-except Exception as e` blocks in most functions to catch general errors and log them. This is robust but could be more specific in some cases.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

- **Functions:** `load_variable_catalog`, `analyze_variable_data`, `generate_report`, etc., use `snake_case` and are descriptive.
- **Variables:** `variable_results`, `alignment_results`, `min_date`, `missing_count` use `snake_case` and are generally clear.
- **Constants:** `HISTORICAL_TIMELINE_DIR`, `PRIORITY_VARIABLES`, `MIN_YEARS` use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` as per PEP 8.
- **Docstrings:** The module has a comprehensive docstring. Functions generally have docstrings explaining their purpose, and some include parameter descriptions.
- **Clarity:** The code is generally straightforward and readable.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

- **Specification:**
    - **Met:** The module's intent is clearly specified in its main docstring.
- **Modularity/Architecture:**
    - **Partially Met:** While internally divided into functions, the script as a whole is a monolithic unit. Hardcoded paths and the `PRIORITY_VARIABLES` list reduce its adaptability without code changes. The HTML generation is embedded, not using templates.
- **Refinement Focus:**
    - **Testability:**
        - **Needs Improvement:** No evidence of dedicated automated tests. The script's reliance on specific file structures and external libraries (plotting) would make testing non-trivial without a good testing strategy (mocking, fixture data).
    - **Security (Hardcoding):**
        - **Met (for secrets):** No secrets (API keys, passwords) are hardcoded.
        - **Needs Improvement (for paths/configs):** Numerous file paths, directory names, variable lists, and analysis parameters are hardcoded, impacting flexibility and maintainability.
    - **Maintainability:**
        - **Fair:** Code is readable with good naming. However, the hardcoding issues mean that changes to data locations, variables of interest, or report styling require direct code edits. Embedded HTML/CSS is less maintainable than templates.
- **No Hardcoding (Critical):**
    - **Needs Improvement:** Significant hardcoding of paths, filenames, variable lists, and reporting thresholds exists.

**Overall SPARC Alignment:** The script is functional for its specific, narrowly defined task. However, its SPARC alignment is hampered by a lack of automated tests and significant hardcoding of paths, configuration parameters, and the primary list of variables to analyze. To improve, it would benefit from externalizing configurations, using a templating engine for reports, and introducing a comprehensive test suite.
