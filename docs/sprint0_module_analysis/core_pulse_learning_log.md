# Module Analysis: core/pulse_learning_log.py

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The [`core/pulse_learning_log.py`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:1) module is designed to log and persist all structural learning updates within the Pulse system. This includes changes to variable trust, symbolic upgrades, revisions, and other meta-learning events. The logs are intended for replay, diagnostics, creating audit trails for meta-learning, and generating visual summaries of the system's evolution. It emphasizes not logging sensitive or personally identifiable information.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **Singleton Logger:** Implements a `PulseLearningLogger` class ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:45`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:45)) as a singleton to ensure a single, consistent logging instance.
*   **Event Logging:**
    *   [`log_event(event_type, data, context)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:64): The core method for logging events. It records a unique `event_id`, `timestamp` (UTC ISO format), `event_type`, and event-specific `data`. Optional `context` can also be included.
    *   Logs are written as JSON lines to a file specified by `LOG_PATH` ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:35`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:35)), which defaults to `logs/pulse_learning_log.jsonl` but can be overridden by the `PULSE_LEARNING_LOG_PATH` environment variable.
    *   Ensures data is flushed and synced to disk ([`os.fsync`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:85)) for durability.
*   **Specific Event Logging Methods:** Provides convenient wrapper methods for common learning events:
    *   [`log_variable_weight_change(var, old_weight, new_weight)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:93)
    *   [`log_symbolic_upgrade(plan)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:110)
    *   [`log_revision_trigger(reason)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:121)
    *   [`log_arc_regret(scores)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:132)
    *   [`log_learning_summary(summary)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:143)
    *   [`log_rule_activation(rule_id, variable_id, outcome, forecast_id, success)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:152)
    *   [`log_bayesian_trust_metrics(key, kind)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:172): Logs trust, confidence interval, strength, and sample size from the `bayesian_trust_tracker`.
    *   [`log_rule_effectiveness(rule_id, activation_count, success_rate, impact_score)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:197)
*   **Trust Data Management (via `bayesian_trust_tracker`):**
    *   [`generate_trust_report(min_samples)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:215): Generates a report using the `bayesian_trust_tracker` and logs an event about the report generation.
    *   [`export_trust_data(filepath)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:233): Exports trust data using the `bayesian_trust_tracker` and logs the export event.
    *   [`import_trust_data(filepath)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:251): Imports trust data using the `bayesian_trust_tracker` and logs the import event.
*   **File Permissions:** Attempts to set log file permissions to owner read/write only (`0o600`) via [`_set_file_permissions(path)`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:38) for enhanced security.
*   **Module-Level Functions:** Provides module-level convenience functions that call the corresponding methods on the singleton logger instance (e.g., [`log_learning_event()`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:271)).
*   **Testing Function:** Includes a `_test_logging()` function ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:361`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:361)) for basic verification of logging functionality, typically run when the script is executed directly.

## 3. Role Within `core/` Directory

This module acts as a central auditing and diagnostic tool within the `core/` directory. It captures the dynamic learning processes of the Pulse system, providing a persistent record of how the system adapts and evolves. This is crucial for understanding system behavior, debugging learning algorithms, and potentially for meta-optimization strategies. It directly interacts with other core components like `path_registry` and `bayesian_trust_tracker`.

## 4. Dependencies

*   **External Libraries:**
    *   `os`: For path manipulation ([`os.environ.get`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:33), [`os.path.dirname`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:36), [`os.makedirs`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:36), [`os.path.exists`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:59), [`os.chmod`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:43), [`os.fsync`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:85)).
    *   `json`: For serializing log entries into JSON format.
    *   `uuid`: For generating unique event IDs ([`uuid.uuid4()`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:74)).
    *   `typing`: For type hints.
    *   `datetime`: For timestamping log entries ([`datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:75)).
    *   `contextlib.suppress`: Used in [`_set_file_permissions`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:42) to ignore exceptions during `chmod`.
*   **Internal Pulse Modules:**
    *   [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py): Used to get the default path for the learning log ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:33`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:33)).
    *   [`core.bayesian_trust_tracker.bayesian_trust_tracker`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py): Used to fetch trust metrics and manage trust data persistence ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:27`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:27), [`core/pulse_learning_log.py:179`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:179) etc.). *Note: The import statement uses `from core.bayesian_trust_tracker import bayesian_trust_tracker`. If the previously analyzed `OptimizedBayesianTrustTracker` is the intended global tracker, this import might need to point to `core.optimized_trust_tracker` instead.*

## 5. SPARC Principles Assessment

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:** Clearly defined in the module docstring. The purpose is to log learning events for audit, diagnostics, and replay.
*   **Operational Status/Completeness:** The module appears operational and provides a good range of logging functions for various learning events. The integration with the Bayesian trust tracker for reporting and persistence is a key feature.
*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   The `bayesian_trust_tracker.generate_report()` method ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:225`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:225)) is called, but the `BayesianTrustTracker` class (from `core.bayesian_trust_tracker`) or `OptimizedBayesianTrustTracker` (from `core.optimized_trust_tracker`) does not seem to have this method. This suggests a potential mismatch or a missing implementation in the tracker module.
    *   Error handling in [`log_event()`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:64) prints to console but doesn't re-raise or provide a more robust failure notification mechanism, which might be an issue for critical logging.
*   **Connections & Dependencies:**
    *   Connects to `path_registry` for log file location.
    *   Strongly connected to `bayesian_trust_tracker` for metrics and data management.
*   **Function and Class Example Usages:** The `_test_logging()` function ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:361`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:361)) serves as a good set of usage examples.
*   **Hardcoding Issues:**
    *   Default log path `logs/pulse_learning_log.jsonl` ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:33`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:33)) is reasonable as it's configurable via `PATHS` and an environment variable.
    *   File permissions `0o600` ([`core/pulse_learning_log.py:43`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:43)) are a sensible default for security.
    *   Default `min_samples` in [`generate_trust_report()`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:215) is a parameter.
*   **Coupling Points:**
    *   Tightly coupled with the `bayesian_trust_tracker` singleton. Changes in the tracker's API (especially regarding report generation or export/import methods) would require updates here.
    *   Relies on `path_registry` for the default log path.
*   **Existing Tests:** The module contains an internal `_test_logging()` function. Dedicated unit tests in the `tests/` directory would be beneficial to cover edge cases and integration points more thoroughly, especially error handling and file operations.
*   **Module Architecture and Flow:**
    *   Singleton pattern for `PulseLearningLogger`.
    *   Centralized `log_event` method with specific helper methods for different event types.
    *   JSONL format for log entries, appended to the log file.
    *   Module-level functions provide a simpler API for users of the logger.
    *   Initialization includes creating the log directory and setting file permissions.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Generally follows PEP 8. Names are descriptive.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness:** The module is largely complete for its defined purpose of logging learning events. It covers a variety of event types relevant to Pulse's learning mechanisms. The main potential incompleteness is the `generate_report` method call on the `bayesian_trust_tracker`, which might not exist as expected.
*   **Quality:** The code is of good quality: well-structured, includes type hints, and considers aspects like file flushing/syncing for reliability and basic file security. Docstrings are present and informative. The singleton pattern is appropriate for a global logger. The provision of module-level functions simplifies usage. The security note at the beginning is a good practice.

## 7. Summary Note for Main Report

The [`core/pulse_learning_log.py`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:1) module provides a robust singleton logger for Pulse's structural learning events, writing timestamped JSONL entries for diagnostics and audit. It integrates with the Bayesian trust tracker for logging trust metrics and managing trust data persistence, though a potential API mismatch with the tracker's report generation needs verification.
