# Module Analysis: `memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:1) module is to identify the "most evolved" forecast within different symbolic clusters. This is achieved by analyzing the ancestry chain (mutation depth) of forecasts. The module aims to find the forecast that represents the most developed line of reasoning within its cluster, making it an ideal candidate for long-term memory representation.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete and operational for its defined scope.
- It includes functions for calculating mutation depth, clustering forecasts, selecting the most evolved forecast per cluster, summarizing depths, and exporting results.
- Logging is implemented for warnings and errors.
- A basic `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153)) provides a minimal test case, suggesting a level of functional completeness.
- There are no obvious placeholders like `TODO` or `FIXME` comments in the provided code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **More Sophisticated Evolution Metrics:** While "mutation depth" (length of ancestry chain) is used, the initial docstring mentions "Maximum symbolic mutation depth" which might imply a more nuanced metric than just the count of ancestors. The current implementation relies solely on the length of the `ancestors` list.
- **Handling of `ForecastMemory` Object:** The [`track_cluster_lineage`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44) function has a check `if hasattr(forecasts, "_memory"): forecasts = forecasts._memory` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:55-56`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:55-56)). This direct access to a private-like attribute `_memory` might indicate an area for potential refactoring or a more formalized API for accessing forecasts from a `ForecastMemory` object if such an object is a standard part of the system.
- **Error Handling in `get_mutation_depth`:** The function logs a warning if `ancestors` is not a list but still returns `0`. Depending on the system's requirements, a more specific error or a different default might be considered.
- **Export Path Validation:** The [`export_mutation_leaders`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) function checks if the path ends with `.jsonl` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:131`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:131)) and raises a `ValueError`. It might be beneficial to also check if the directory for the path exists or handle `FileNotFoundError` more specifically if the directory is invalid, though `OSError` is caught.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from other project modules:
-   [`forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier.classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py) ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:20`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:20))

### External library dependencies:
-   `json` (standard library) ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:15`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:15))
-   `os` (standard library) ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:16`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:16))
-   `logging` (standard library) ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:17`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:17))
-   `typing` (standard library - `List`, `Dict`) ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:18`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:18))
-   `collections.defaultdict` (standard library) ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:19`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:19))

### Interaction with other modules via shared data:
-   The module processes forecast dictionaries, which are expected to have a specific structure (e.g., `{"lineage": {"ancestors": [...]}}`). This structure is a contract with modules that produce or consume these forecasts.
-   It consumes forecasts that are classifiable by [`classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py).

### Input/output files:
-   **Input:** Expects a list of forecast dictionaries or a `ForecastMemory` object (though direct interaction with `_memory` attribute).
-   **Output:** Can export the "most evolved" forecasts to a `.jsonl` file via the [`export_mutation_leaders`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) function. The example usage comments out an export to `"test_leaders.jsonl"` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165)).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module primarily consists of functions.

-   **`get_mutation_depth(forecast: Dict) -> int`**:
    ```python
    forecast_example = {"id": 1, "lineage": {"ancestors": [0, "another_ancestor_id"]}}
    depth = get_mutation_depth(forecast_example)
    # depth would be 2
    ```
    This function calculates how many ancestors a forecast has.

-   **`track_cluster_lineage(forecasts) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]`**:
    ```python
    # Assuming classify_forecast_cluster exists and works
    forecast_list = [
        {"id": 1, "data": "...", "lineage": {"ancestors": [0]}}, # assume cluster 'A'
        {"id": 2, "data": "...", "lineage": {"ancestors": [0,1]}}, # assume cluster 'B'
        {"id": 3, "data": "...", "lineage": {"ancestors": []}}  # assume cluster 'A'
    ]
    clustered_forecasts = track_cluster_lineage(forecast_list)
    # clustered_forecasts would be:
    # {
    #   'A': [
    #       {"id": 1, ..., "narrative_cluster": "A"},
    #       {"id": 3, ..., "narrative_cluster": "A"}
    #   ],
    #   'B': [
    #       {"id": 2, ..., "narrative_cluster": "B"}
    #   ]
    # }
    ```
    This function groups forecasts based on their narrative cluster, determined by [`classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py).

-   **`select_most_evolved(clusters: Dict[str, List[Dict]]) -> Dict[str, Dict]`**:
    ```python
    # Using clustered_forecasts from above
    evolved_leaders = select_most_evolved(clustered_forecasts)
    # evolved_leaders would be:
    # {
    #   'A': {"id": 1, ..., "narrative_cluster": "A"}, # assuming id 1 has depth 1, id 3 has depth 0
    #   'B': {"id": 2, ..., "narrative_cluster": "B"}  # depth 2
    # }
    ```
    This function picks the forecast with the greatest mutation depth from each cluster.

-   **`summarize_mutation_depths(clusters: Dict[str, List[Dict]]) -> Dict[str, int]`**:
    ```python
    # Using clustered_forecasts from above
    depth_summary = summarize_mutation_depths(clustered_forecasts)
    # depth_summary would be:
    # {
    #   'A': 1,
    #   'B': 2
    # }
    ```
    This function reports the maximum mutation depth found within each cluster.

-   **`export_mutation_leaders(leaders: Dict[str, Dict], path: str)`**:
    ```python
    # Using evolved_leaders from above
    # export_mutation_leaders(evolved_leaders, "output/evolved_forecasts.jsonl")
    # This would create a file "output/evolved_forecasts.jsonl" with each leader forecast as a JSON line.
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Temporary File Suffix:** The [`export_mutation_leaders`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) function uses a hardcoded `".tmp"` suffix for temporary files ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:134`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:134)). While common, this could potentially be configurable if needed in diverse environments.
-   **Default Logging Level:** Logging is configured to `logging.INFO` by default ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:23`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:23)). This is a common practice but is a hardcoded default.
-   **`"narrative_cluster"` key:** The key `"narrative_cluster"` is hardcoded when adding cluster information to forecasts within [`track_cluster_lineage`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:61).

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **`forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier`**: Tightly coupled to this module for the [`classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py) function, which is essential for grouping forecasts. Changes in the classifier's logic or its expected input/output could directly impact this module.
-   **Forecast Data Structure:** The module heavily relies on a specific dictionary structure for forecasts, particularly the `{"lineage": {"ancestors": [...]}}` path for determining mutation depth. Any changes to this structure in other parts of the system would break this module.
-   **`ForecastMemory` Object (Implicit):** The check `hasattr(forecasts, "_memory")` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:55`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:55)) creates an implicit coupling to the internal structure of a `ForecastMemory` object, if used.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   **Inline Test Block:** A simple test block exists under `if __name__ == "__main__":` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153-165`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153-165)). This block tests [`track_cluster_lineage`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44), [`select_most_evolved`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:66), and [`summarize_mutation_depths`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:93) with a small, predefined list of forecasts. The [`export_mutation_leaders`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) call is commented out.
-   **Dedicated Test File:** Based on the `list_files` output for the `tests/` directory, there does not appear to be a specific test file (e.g., `test_cluster_mutation_tracker.py`).
-   **Coverage:** The inline tests provide basic smoke testing for the core logic but do not cover edge cases, error conditions (e.g., malformed forecast data, issues with `classify_forecast_cluster`), or the file export functionality comprehensively. Formal test coverage is likely low.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Input:** A list of forecast dictionaries (or a `ForecastMemory` object).
2.  **Clustering ([`track_cluster_lineage`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44)):**
    *   Each forecast is passed to [`classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py) to determine its narrative cluster.
    *   Forecasts are grouped into a dictionary where keys are cluster names and values are lists of forecasts belonging to that cluster.
3.  **Evolution Analysis:**
    *   **Depth Calculation ([`get_mutation_depth`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26)):** For each forecast, the mutation depth is calculated as the number of its ancestors (length of `forecast["lineage"]["ancestors"]`).
    *   **Leader Selection ([`select_most_evolved`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:66)):** Within each cluster, the forecast with the maximum mutation depth is identified as the "leader" or "most evolved."
    *   **Depth Summary ([`summarize_mutation_depths`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:93)):** The maximum mutation depth for each cluster is calculated.
4.  **Output (Optional via [`export_mutation_leaders`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120)):**
    *   The identified leaders (most evolved forecasts per cluster) can be written to a `.jsonl` file.

The module is procedural, composed of several distinct functional steps. Data flows from raw forecasts, through clustering, to selection based on mutation depth, and finally to summarization or export.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Functions:** Generally follow PEP 8 (snake_case, descriptive names like [`get_mutation_depth`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26), [`track_cluster_lineage`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44)).
-   **Variables:** Mostly snake_case (e.g., `fc_list`, `mutation_depth_fn`). `fc` is used as a shorthand for forecast, which is common but could be more explicit if preferred.
-   **Module Name:** `cluster_mutation_tracker.py` is descriptive.
-   **Constants/Loggers:** `logger` is standard.
-   **Clarity:** Names are generally clear and indicate their purpose.
-   **AI Assumption Errors:** The author is listed as "Pulse AI Engine." The code quality and conventions are reasonable and do not show obvious signs of problematic AI-generated naming that deviates significantly from Python norms. The use of `_memory` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:56`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:56)) is a Python convention for internal use, which is appropriate if `ForecastMemory` is designed with that in mind.

No major deviations from PEP 8 or significant inconsistencies were noted.
