# SPARC Analysis: `intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py`

**Version:** 0.5 (as per module docstring)
**Author:** Pulse Intelligence Core (as per module docstring)

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (Specification)

The primary role of the [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22) module is to manage "epistemic upgrade proposals." It acts as a temporary holding area (sandbox) where these proposals can be submitted, listed, and retrieved for review before they undergo a "trust-gated promotion" process, which is handled externally to this module.

Key functionalities include:
- Submitting new upgrade proposals.
- Listing IDs of all pending upgrades.
- Retrieving detailed information for a specific upgrade proposal.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally functional for its defined scope of managing proposals within a file-based sandbox.
- It handles basic CRUD-like operations (Create via submit, Read via list/get_details) for proposals.
- Version 0.5 suggests it might not be considered fully mature or feature-complete for a production system.
- The error handling in [`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37) (line 57) notes: `"Depending on desired error handling, you might re-raise or return a specific error indicator"`, suggesting this area could be further refined.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Promotion Mechanism:** The "trust-gated promotion" mentioned in the docstring is not implemented here; this module only manages the sandbox stage.
- **Proposal Lifecycle Management:** There are no functions for deleting, archiving, or updating submitted proposals.
- **Error Handling/Logging:** Current error handling primarily prints messages to standard output and sometimes re-raises exceptions (e.g., [`IOError`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:55) in [`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37)) or returns `None`/empty list. A more robust logging strategy (e.g., using the `logging` module) and potentially custom exceptions could improve maintainability and diagnosability.
- **Scalability/Performance:** Storing all proposals in a single JSONL file ([`pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35)) might lead to performance issues if the number of proposals becomes very large, as listing and retrieving details involve reading through the file.
- **Concurrency:** The current file-based approach is not designed for concurrent access. If multiple processes were to interact with the sandbox, file locking or a different backend (like a database) would be necessary.
- **Configuration of Filename:** The filename `pending_upgrades.jsonl` is hardcoded.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

**Direct Imports:**
- `json`: Standard Python library for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
- `os`: Standard Python library for interacting with the operating system (e.g., creating directories with [`os.makedirs()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:34), joining paths with [`os.path.join()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35)).
- `uuid`: Standard Python library for generating universally unique identifiers ([`uuid.uuid4()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:49)).
- `typing.Dict, Any, List, Optional`: For type hinting, enhancing code clarity and static analysis.
- `intelligence.intelligence_config.UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR`: A crucial dependency that provides the directory path for the sandbox. This externalizes the storage location. ([`intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:20`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:20))

**Interactions:**
- **File System:** The module heavily interacts with the file system by:
    - Creating the sandbox directory if it doesn't exist ([`os.makedirs(self.sandbox_dir, exist_ok=True)`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:34)).
    - Reading from and appending to the [`pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35) file located within the `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR`. This file serves as the persistent store for upgrade proposals.

**Input/Output Files:**
- **Primary Data File:** [`pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35)
    - **Output:** When [`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37) is called, a new JSON line representing the proposal is appended.
    - **Input:** When [`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61) or [`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87) are called, this file is read.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module defines one class: [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22).

-   **`UpgradeSandboxManager(sandbox_dir: str = UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR)`**
    -   **Description:** Initializes the manager. It sets the directory where upgrade proposals will be stored (defaults to `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` from config) and ensures this directory exists. It also defines the full path to the `pending_upgrades.jsonl` file.
    -   **Example (from `if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
        ```python
        sandbox = UpgradeSandboxManager()
        ```

-   **`submit_upgrade(self, upgrade_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str`**
    -   **Description:** Takes a dictionary (`upgrade_data`) containing the details of a new proposal. It assigns a unique `upgrade_id` (using `uuid.uuid4()`), adds this ID to the `upgrade_data`, and then appends the entire proposal as a JSON string to a new line in the `pending_upgrades.jsonl` file.
    -   **Returns:** The unique `upgrade_id` string.
    -   **Example (from `if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
        ```python
        dummy_upgrade = {
            "proposed_variables": ["hope_drift", "trust_collapse"],
            "proposed_consequences": ["market_stability_shift"],
            "notes": "Test upgrade example."
        }
        upgrade_id = sandbox.submit_upgrade(dummy_upgrade)
        ```

-   **`list_pending_upgrades(self) -> List[str]`**
    -   **Description:** Reads the `pending_upgrades.jsonl` file line by line. For each valid JSON line, it extracts the `upgrade_id`.
    -   **Returns:** A list of all `upgrade_id` strings found. Returns an empty list if the file doesn't exist, is empty, or if reading errors occur.
    -   **Example (from `if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
        ```python
        pending_ids = sandbox.list_pending_upgrades()
        print("[UpgradeSandbox] Pending upgrades:", pending_ids)
        ```

-   **`get_upgrade_details(self, upgrade_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]`**
    -   **Description:** Searches the `pending_upgrades.jsonl` file for a proposal matching the given `upgrade_id`.
    -   **Returns:** The full proposal data as a dictionary if found, otherwise `None`.
    -   **Example (from `if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
        ```python
        details = sandbox.get_upgrade_details(some_upgrade_id)
        if details:
            print("[UpgradeSandbox] Details for upgrade:", details)
        ```
The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119-131`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119)) itself provides a concise usage example demonstrating the core functionalities.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

-   **`UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR`**: This crucial path is imported from [`intelligence.intelligence_config`](intelligence/intelligence_config.py:20). While not hardcoded *in this file*, its nature (e.g., an absolute path, reliance on environment variables) within `intelligence_config.py` would determine if it constitutes a hardcoding issue for the system. This module correctly externalizes it.
-   **Filename `pending_upgrades.jsonl`**: The name of the file used to store proposals is hardcoded within the [`__init__`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:26) method (line 35: `self.pending_upgrades_path: str = os.path.join(self.sandbox_dir, "pending_upgrades.jsonl")`). This could be made configurable if different sandbox instances or naming conventions were required.
-   **JSON Keys**: Strings like `"upgrade_id"` (lines 50, 77, 107) are used as keys for dictionary access and JSON structure. This is standard practice for defining a data schema but represents a fixed string.
-   **Default Value `"unknown"`**: In [`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61) (line 77), if an `upgrade_id` key is missing from a parsed JSON line, `"unknown"` is used as a placeholder.
-   **Log/Print Prefixes**: Strings like `"[Sandbox] âœ…"` (e.g., line 54) are hardcoded in print statements. For more formal logging, these might be part of a logger's configuration.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **Configuration (`intelligence.intelligence_config`)**: Tightly coupled to `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` from the [`intelligence.intelligence_config`](intelligence/intelligence_config.py:20) module. Changes to how this configuration is provided or its value directly impact the sandbox's location.
-   **File System & Format (`pending_upgrades.jsonl`)**:
    -   Strongly coupled to the file system as its persistence mechanism.
    -   Strongly coupled to the JSONL (JSON Lines) format. Each proposal is a single JSON object on a new line. Any change to this storage format would require significant modification to all methods.
-   **Data Schema**: Implicitly coupled to the expected structure of the `upgrade_data` dictionary (e.g., expecting an `upgrade_id` key to be present or addable).

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

-   **Formal Unit Tests:** There are no formal unit tests (e.g., using `pytest` or `unittest` frameworks) apparent in or imported by this module. This is a significant gap for ensuring robustness and facilitating refactoring.
-   **Informal/Smoke Tests:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119-131`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:119)) acts as a basic smoke test or example usage. It covers:
    -   Instance creation.
    -   Submitting a dummy upgrade.
    -   Listing pending upgrades.
    -   Retrieving details of the submitted upgrade.
-   **Test Coverage & Gaps:**
    -   The existing smoke test provides minimal coverage.
    -   **Untested Scenarios:**
        -   Behavior when `pending_upgrades.jsonl` is empty or does not exist (though handled gracefully by returning empty lists/`None`).
        -   Handling of malformed JSON lines within the file (partially handled by printing an error and continuing, but the extent of recovery could be tested).
        -   Error conditions during file I/O (e.g., permissions issues, disk full â€“ partially handled by printing errors and raising `IOError` in `submit_upgrade`).
        -   Retrieving details for a non-existent `upgrade_id`.
        -   Scalability with a large number of proposals.
        -   Idempotency of operations (though `submit_upgrade` generates new UUIDs, making resubmission of identical data result in new entries).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

-   **Structure:** The module is organized around a single class, [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22), which encapsulates all functionality.
-   **Persistence:** It employs a simple file-based persistence strategy using a JSONL file ([`pending_upgrades.jsonl`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:35)) stored in a configurable directory.
-   **Data Flow:**
    1.  **Initialization ([`__init__()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:26)):** Sets up the `sandbox_dir` and the path to `pending_upgrades.jsonl`. Ensures the directory exists.
    2.  **Submission ([`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37)):**
        -   Input: `upgrade_data` (dictionary).
        -   Process: Generates a `uuid`, adds it to `upgrade_data`, serializes to JSON, appends to `pending_upgrades.jsonl`.
        -   Output: `upgrade_id` (string).
    3.  **Listing ([`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61)):**
        -   Input: None (reads from `pending_upgrades.jsonl`).
        -   Process: Reads file line by line, deserializes JSON, extracts `upgrade_id`.
        -   Output: `List[str]` of upgrade IDs.
    4.  **Details Retrieval ([`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87)):**
        -   Input: `upgrade_id` (string).
        -   Process: Reads `pending_upgrades.jsonl` line by line, deserializes JSON, compares `upgrade_id`.
        -   Output: `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` (the proposal data).
-   **Modularity:** The module is well-contained, focusing solely on the sandbox functionality. It relies on an external configuration for its storage path, which is good practice.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

-   **Class Name:** [`UpgradeSandboxManager`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:22) is descriptive and uses `PascalCase` (CapWords), adhering to PEP 8.
-   **Method Names:** Methods like [`submit_upgrade()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:37), [`list_pending_upgrades()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:61), and [`get_upgrade_details()`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:87) use `snake_case` and clearly indicate their purpose, following PEP 8.
-   **Variable Names:** Variables such as `sandbox_dir`, `pending_upgrades_path`, `upgrade_data`, `upgrade_id` are in `snake_case` and are generally descriptive.
-   **Constants:** `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` (imported) is in `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`, which is standard for constants.
-   **Docstrings & Comments:**
    -   The module has a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose, author, and version ([`intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:3-14`](intelligence/upgrade_sandbox_manager.py:3)).
    -   The class and all public methods have clear docstrings detailing their functionality, arguments, and return values, following good Python practices.
-   **Type Hinting:** The code makes good use of type hints (`Dict`, `Any`, `List`, `Optional` from the `typing` module), which significantly improves readability, maintainability, and allows for static analysis.
-   **Overall:** Naming conventions are consistent and largely adhere to PEP 8, contributing positively to maintainability. No obvious AI assumption errors in naming.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

-   **Specification:**
    -   **Adherence:** Good. The module's purpose and basic functionality are clearly specified in its docstring.
    -   **Gaps:** The broader context of "trust-gated promotion" is mentioned but outside this module's scope.

-   **Modularity/Architecture:**
    -   **Adherence:** Good. The module encapsulates sandbox management logic into a single, focused class. It relies on external configuration for its directory, promoting loose coupling in that regard. The architecture is simple (file-based).
    -   **Concerns:** Dependency on a single file for all proposals might not scale well. Lack of concurrency control.

-   **Refinement:**
    -   **Testability:**
        -   **Adherence:** Poor. Lacks formal unit tests. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides only basic smoke testing.
        -   **SPARC Critical:** This is a key area for improvement to ensure reliability and safe refactoring.
    -   **Security:**
        -   **Adherence:** Fair. No direct hardcoding of secrets like API keys or passwords.
        -   **Concerns:** Security relies on the proper configuration of `UPGRADE_SANDBOX_DIR` and file system permissions, which are external to this module. The data itself (upgrade proposals) might be sensitive, and storing it in a plain JSONL file means its security depends entirely on file system access controls. No explicit input validation on `upgrade_data` beyond what `json.dumps` handles.
    -   **Maintainability:**
        -   **Adherence:** Good. Clear naming conventions (PEP 8 compliant), good use of docstrings, and type hints contribute to high maintainability. The code is straightforward and relatively easy to understand.

-   **No Hardcoding (SPARC Critical):**
    -   **Adherence:** Fair. The critical directory path is externalized.
    -   **Issues:** The filename `pending_upgrades.jsonl` is hardcoded. Some minor string literals for JSON keys and print messages exist.

**Overall SPARC Assessment:**
The module demonstrates good adherence to SPARC principles in terms of **Specification**, basic **Modularity**, and **Maintainability** (due to good naming, docstrings, and type hints). However, it falls short in **Testability** (lack of formal tests) which is a critical aspect of Refinement. While direct security hardcoding is avoided, the reliance on file system security for potentially sensitive proposal data and the hardcoded filename are minor concerns. The file-based architecture is simple but has scalability and concurrency limitations.
