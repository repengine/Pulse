# Module Analysis: `dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The `dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py` module is a static analysis tool designed to scan Python files within the Pulse project and identify potential keyword argument mismatches in function calls. Its primary goal is to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors by detecting incorrect keyword argument usage before execution.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   Recursively scans a specified root directory (defaulting to the current directory) for `.py` files.
*   Parses Python files using the `ast` module to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
*   Extracts function definitions, including their argument names, from the ASTs ([`parse_function_defs()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:32)).
*   Collects all function definitions across the project into a global map ([`collect_all_function_defs()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:57)).
*   Identifies function calls within the ASTs.
*   Supports validation for both simple function calls (`func(...)`) and attribute calls (`module.func(...)`).
*   Compares the keyword arguments used in each call against the collected definitions for the called function ([`validate_keywords_against_definitions()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:79)).
*   Reports any keyword arguments used in a call that are not present in the function's definition.
*   Provides command-line options to specify the root directory (`--root`), enable verbose logging (`--verbose`), and filter reports for a specific function name (`--filter`).
*   Handles file parsing errors gracefully (e.g., encoding issues, syntax errors) by logging a warning and skipping the problematic file.
*   Uses UTF-8 decoding with an `errors="ignore"` fallback for reading files.
*   Prints a summary of issues found.

## 3. Role within `dev_tools/`

This module serves as a static code analysis and linting tool within the `dev_tools/` directory. Its role is to help maintain code correctness and robustness by proactively identifying a common source of errors: mismatched keyword arguments in function calls. This is particularly useful in a large project where function signatures might change or be easily forgotten.

## 4. Dependencies

### Internal Pulse Modules:
*   [`utils.log_utils.get_logger`](utils/log_utils.py) (imported as `get_logger` and used to initialize `logger`)

### External Libraries:
*   `ast` (Python standard library): Core library for parsing Python code into an AST.
*   `os` (Python standard library): Used for file system navigation (walking directories).
*   `argparse` (Python standard library): Used for parsing command-line arguments.
*   `typing.Dict`, `typing.List`, `typing.Any` (Python standard library): Used for type hinting.

## 5. SPARC Principles Adherence Assessment

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:** Clearly defined in the module docstring ([`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:1-23`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:1)). The tool has a specific and valuable purpose for code quality.
*   **Operational Status/Completeness:** The module appears to be operational and largely complete for its defined scope. It successfully scans, parses, and validates keyword arguments.
*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   **Cross-module import tracking:** The docstring mentions "Cross-module import tracking" ([`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:9`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:9)), but the current implementation primarily relies on a global function name map. True cross-module import tracking (e.g., resolving `module_alias.function_name` to its original definition in another file) might not be fully robust, especially with complex aliasing or dynamic imports. The current approach of using `func_map[func_name][0]["args"]` ([`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:120`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:120)) assumes the first definition found for a function name is the canonical one, which might not always hold true if functions with the same name exist in different modules and are called without explicit module qualification.
    *   **Handling of `*args` and `**kwargs`:** The validator checks if a keyword argument exists in the defined arguments. It doesn't explicitly account for functions defined with `**kwargs`, where any keyword argument would be valid. This could lead to false positives if a function is designed to accept arbitrary keyword arguments.
    *   **Scope and Context:** The current AST walk identifies function calls but might not fully resolve the scope to determine which specific function definition (if multiple exist with the same name in different imported modules) is being targeted.
*   **Connections & Dependencies:** Dependencies are standard Python libraries and one internal utility. The primary external dependency is the Python code structure itself that it analyzes.
*   **Function and Class Example Usages:** The script is executed directly. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:145`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:145)) demonstrates its primary workflow. Key functions are [`collect_all_function_defs()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:57) and [`validate_keywords_against_definitions()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:79).
*   **Hardcoding Issues:** No significant hardcoding issues were identified. Directory traversal ignores hidden directories (`.`) and files starting with `__` ([`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:69`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:69), [`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:71`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:71), [`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:94`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:94), [`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:96`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:96)), which is a reasonable convention.
*   **Coupling Points:**
    *   Tightly coupled to the Python language's AST structure. Changes in Python's AST format (though rare for stable features) could break the parser.
    *   Relies on file system structure for discovering Python files.
*   **Existing Tests:** No tests are included within this module file.
*   **Module Architecture and Flow:**
    1.  Parse command-line arguments ([`parse_args()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:132)).
    2.  Walk the specified directory to find all `.py` files.
    3.  For each file, parse it into an AST and extract all function definitions ([`parse_function_defs()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:32)) to build a global map ([`collect_all_function_defs()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:57)).
    4.  Re-walk the directory (or use the already parsed ASTs if optimized).
    5.  For each function call node in each file's AST:
        *   Identify the function name (handling simple and attribute calls).
        *   If a filter is applied, skip if the function name doesn't match.
        *   Look up the function definition in the global map.
        *   Compare keyword arguments in the call against the definition's arguments.
        *   Collect any mismatches ([`validate_keywords_against_definitions()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:79)).
    6.  Report found mismatches or confirm no issues.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Generally follows PEP 8.

## 6. Overall Assessment (Completeness and Quality)

*   **Completeness:** The module is substantially complete for its core task of identifying basic keyword argument mismatches.
*   **Quality:**
    *   **Strengths:** The tool addresses a practical problem in large codebases. It uses Python's `ast` module, which is the correct approach for static analysis of Python code. Error handling for file parsing is good. Command-line options provide useful flexibility. The code is reasonably well-documented with docstrings.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   **Robustness of Function Resolution:** The current method of resolving function calls to definitions (using the first encountered definition for a given name) could be improved. A more sophisticated approach might involve building a more detailed import graph or symbol table to correctly resolve which function is being called, especially in cases of identically named functions in different modules or complex import aliasing.
        *   **Handling `**kwargs`:** The validator should ideally recognize functions defined with `**kwargs` and not flag valid keyword arguments passed to them. This might involve checking `node.args.kwarg` in [`parse_function_defs()`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:32).
        *   **Efficiency:** The script walks the directory tree twice: once to collect definitions and once to validate calls. This could be optimized by parsing each file once and performing both steps, though this might increase memory usage if all ASTs are kept in memory. Given the nature of the task, the current approach might be a reasonable trade-off.
        *   **UTF-8 decoding fallback:** Using `errors="ignore"` ([`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:41`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:41), [`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:100`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:100)) can lead to silent data loss or misinterpretation if files are not truly UTF-8. While it prevents crashes, it might be better to log a more specific warning or attempt other common encodings if UTF-8 fails.

## 7. Summary Note for Main Report

The [`dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py`](dev_tools/pulse_code_validator.py:1) module is a useful static analysis tool for detecting keyword argument mismatches in Python function calls across the project. It parses code using `ast` and provides configurable reporting, though its function resolution and handling of `**kwargs` could be enhanced for greater accuracy.
