# Module Analysis: core/schemas.py

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The [`core/schemas.py`](core/schemas.py:1) module defines Pydantic models used for data validation and structuring within the Pulse system. Specifically, these schemas are intended for validating Pulse forecasts, various log entries (overlay, trust score, capital outcome, digest tags), and potentially configuration data. The use of Pydantic ensures data integrity and provides clear data contracts.

## 2. Key Functionalities

The module defines several Pydantic `BaseModel` classes:

*   **[`ForecastRecord(BaseModel)`](core/schemas.py:10):**
    *   Defines the structure for a forecast record.
    *   Fields: `forecast_id` (str, required), `timestamp` (Optional[str]), `variables` (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]), `confidence` (Optional[float]), `fragility` (Optional[float]), `symbolic_overlay` (Optional[str]), `trust_score` (Optional[float]), `domain` (Optional[str]).
    *   Includes a comment `# Add more fields as needed`, indicating it's extensible.
*   **[`OverlayLog(BaseModel)`](core/schemas.py:21):**
    *   Defines the structure for an overlay log entry.
    *   Fields: `overlay` (str, required), `old_value` (float, required), `new_value` (float, required), `timestamp` (str, required).
*   **[`TrustScoreLog(BaseModel)`](core/schemas.py:27):**
    *   Defines the structure for a trust score log entry.
    *   Fields: `scenario_id` (str, required), `trust_score` (float, required), `timestamp` (str, required).
*   **[`CapitalOutcome(BaseModel)`](core/schemas.py:32):**
    *   Defines the structure for a capital outcome log entry.
    *   Fields: `scenario_id` (str, required), `capital` (float, required), `timestamp` (str, required).
*   **[`DigestTag(BaseModel)`](core/schemas.py:37):**
    *   Defines the structure for a digest tag log entry.
    *   Fields: `scenario_id` (str, required), `tag` (str, required), `timestamp` (str, required).

The module also includes a comment `# Add more schemas as needed for other logs/configs` ([`core/schemas.py:42`](core/schemas.py:42)), suggesting it's a central place for defining new data structures.

## 3. Role Within `core/` Directory

This module serves as a central repository for data structure definitions (schemas) used throughout the `core` components and potentially other parts of the Pulse system. By using Pydantic models, it enforces data validation, improves code readability by making data structures explicit, and aids in serialization/deserialization tasks. It's a foundational module for ensuring data consistency.

## 4. Dependencies

*   **External Libraries:**
    *   `pydantic.BaseModel`, `pydantic.Field`: Core components from the Pydantic library used to define the schemas.
    *   `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, `typing.Optional`, `typing.Any`: Standard Python typing hints.
    *   `datetime.datetime`: Although imported, `datetime` objects are not directly used as field types; timestamps are defined as `str`. This implies that ISO format strings are expected for timestamps, which Pydantic can validate or convert.
*   **Internal Pulse Modules:**
    *   None are directly imported. This module provides foundational data structures for other modules to use.

## 5. SPARC Principles Assessment

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:** Clearly stated in the module docstring: "Pydantic models for Pulse forecast, log, and config validation."
*   **Operational Status/Completeness:** The defined schemas are operational for their specified purpose. The module is designed to be extensible, as indicated by comments. Its completeness depends on whether all currently required data structures within Pulse are defined here.
*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   The `timestamp` fields are defined as `Optional[str]` in [`ForecastRecord`](core/schemas.py:12) but `str` (implying required) in other log schemas like [`OverlayLog`](core/schemas.py:25). Consistency in whether timestamps are always required or can be optional might be beneficial, or the distinction is intentional.
    *   While `datetime` is imported, using `datetime.datetime` directly as a Pydantic field type (e.g., `timestamp: datetime`) would leverage Pydantic's built-in parsing and validation for datetime objects, potentially offering more robustness than `str`.
    *   The comment `# Add more fields as needed` in [`ForecastRecord`](core/schemas.py:19) and `# Add more schemas as needed` ([`core/schemas.py:42`](core/schemas.py:42)) are good placeholders but imply ongoing development.
*   **Connections & Dependencies:** This module is expected to be a dependency for many other modules that handle or generate data conforming to these schemas (e.g., forecasting engines, logging systems, configuration loaders). It has no outgoing dependencies on other Pulse modules.
*   **Function and Class Example Usages:** No direct usage examples are provided within this module, which is typical for schema definition files. Examples would reside in modules that utilize these schemas.
*   **Hardcoding Issues:** No hardcoding issues are apparent, as the module defines data structures rather than logic with fixed values.
*   **Coupling Points:** Loosely coupled. Other modules will depend on these schema definitions. Changes to these schemas (e.g., adding/removing fields, changing types) will impact any module that uses them.
*   **Existing Tests:** The file list does not immediately show a dedicated test file like `test_schemas.py`. Tests would typically involve validating data against these schemas, ensuring both valid and invalid data are handled correctly by Pydantic.
*   **Module Architecture and Flow:** Simple and direct: imports necessary Pydantic and typing components, then defines a series of `BaseModel` classes.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Adheres to Python (PEP 8) naming conventions. Class names are `CamelCase`, and field names are `snake_case`.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness:** The module provides a good starting set of schemas for core data types. Its true completeness is relative to the overall system's needs, and it's designed for extension.
*   **Quality:** The code quality is good. It leverages a robust library (Pydantic) for data validation, uses type hints, and is well-organized. The definitions are clear and concise. Using `datetime` type directly for timestamps could be a minor improvement.

## 7. Summary Note for Main Report

The [`core/schemas.py`](core/schemas.py:1) module defines essential Pydantic models for data validation and structure within Pulse, covering forecasts and various log types. It promotes data integrity and serves as an extensible foundation for data contracts across the system.
