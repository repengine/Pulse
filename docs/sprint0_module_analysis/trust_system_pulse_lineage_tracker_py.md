# Module Analysis: `trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py`

**Version:** As per docstring: `v0.100.9`
**Location:** `trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`pulse_lineage_tracker.py`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:2) module is to analyze the evolutionary history of forecasts within the Pulse system. It focuses on tracing how "symbolic arcs" (connections or relationships in the forecast model) and rule-based logic change across different generations of forecasts. Key functions include building generation chains (lineage trees), identifying shifts in logic, tracking the persistence or recurrence of rules, and noting reversals or changes in symbolic arcs. The module aims to provide a summary of this lineage to understand the stability and evolution of forecast reasoning.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope. It includes:
*   Functions to build lineage trees ([`build_lineage_tree()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:26)).
*   Grouping forecasts by generation depth ([`group_by_generation()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:37)).
*   Mapping arc evolution ([`arc_evolution_map()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:56)).
*   Tracking rule recurrence ([`rule_recurrence_chain()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:67)).
*   A summary function ([`lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77)) that aggregates these analyses.
*   A basic Command Line Interface (CLI) for processing a JSONL file of forecasts (lines 102-113).
*   A simple inline "unit test" ([`_test_lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:91)) for the summary function.

No explicit `TODO`, `FIXME`, or obvious placeholder comments indicating unfinished sections were found. The functionality described in the module's docstring (lines 10-14) seems to be implemented.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

While functionally complete for its current scope, potential areas for extension or further development include:

*   **Advanced Analysis:** The current analysis is largely quantitative (counts, groupings). It could be expanded to include qualitative analysis, such as identifying specific patterns of arc changes (e.g., frequent reversals, stabilization over generations) or scoring the overall stability of a lineage.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The CLI part performs basic file reading. More robust error handling for malformed input data (e.g., missing expected keys in forecast objects, incorrect JSONL format) could be added to the functions themselves.
*   **Scalability:** For extremely large sets of forecasts or very deep lineage trees, the current in-memory processing and recursive depth calculation in [`group_by_generation()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:43) might face limitations.
*   **Visualization:** The output is a JSON summary. Visualizing the lineage tree or arc evolution could provide more intuitive insights.
*   **Configuration:** Beyond the input file path, there are no external configuration options for the analysis (e.g., thresholds for "significant" changes, specific arcs/rules to focus on).
*   **Integration with Testing Framework:** The existing test is inline and minimal. Integrating with a standard testing framework like `pytest` would allow for more comprehensive and structured testing.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:** None are apparent within this file. It operates as a standalone utility processing input data.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): Used for loading forecast data from the input JSONL file.
    *   [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html): Used for emitting informational messages during processing.
    *   `typing` ([`Dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Dict), [`List`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.List), [`Tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Tuple)): Used for type hinting.
    *   [`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict): Utilized in several functions for convenient dictionary initialization.
    *   [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html): Used in the CLI section for parsing command-line arguments.
*   **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    *   The module's primary interaction is through the input forecast data, expected to be a JSONL file. Each line should be a JSON object representing a single forecast. These forecast objects are presumably generated by other components of the Pulse system.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** A JSONL file containing forecast data, specified via the `--file` command-line argument (line 106). The structure of each JSON object is expected to contain keys like `trace_id`, `parent_id`, `arc_label`, and `rule_id`.
    *   **Output:**
        *   A JSON formatted summary of the lineage trace printed to standard output when run as a CLI tool (line 112).
        *   Log messages are generated via the `logging` module (e.g., line 24, 34). The destination of these logs (console, file) would depend on the external logging configuration of the broader system.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module primarily consists of functions. Key functions and their intended usage:

*   **[`build_lineage_tree(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:26):**
    *   Takes a list of forecast dictionaries.
    *   Returns a dictionary representing the lineage tree, mapping each `parent_id` to a list of its child `trace_id`s.
    *   Example: `tree = build_lineage_tree([{"trace_id": "B", "parent_id": "A"}, {"trace_id": "C", "parent_id": "A"}])` would result in `tree` being `{"A": ["B", "C"]}`.

*   **[`group_by_generation(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[int, List[Dict]]`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:37):**
    *   Organizes forecasts into generations based on their depth in the lineage tree (distance from an initial forecast with no parent).
    *   Returns a dictionary mapping generation number (integer) to a list of forecast objects belonging to that generation.

*   **[`arc_evolution_map(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:56):**
    *   Maps each `parent_id` to a list of `arc_label`s found in its direct children forecasts. This helps track how arcs originating from a parent evolve or diversify in the next generation.
    *   If an `arc_label` is missing, it defaults to `"Unknown"` (line 62).

*   **[`rule_recurrence_chain(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, int]`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:67):**
    *   Counts the occurrences of each `rule_id` across all provided forecasts.
    *   Returns a dictionary mapping `rule_id` to its frequency (integer count).

*   **[`lineage_trace_summary(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77):**
    *   This is the main analysis function that orchestrates calls to the above helpers.
    *   It takes a list of forecasts and returns a dictionary summarizing the lineage, including counts of forecasts per generation, rule recurrence frequencies, the arc evolution map, and the total number of forecasts processed.
    *   Usage is demonstrated in the CLI section (line 111) and the internal test ([`_test_lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:91)).

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Arc Label:** In [`arc_evolution_map()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:62), if a forecast dictionary lacks an `arc_label` key, it defaults to the string `"Unknown"`. This is a reasonable default for missing data rather than a problematic hardcoding.
*   **Logger Name:** The logger is named `"pulse_lineage_tracker"` (line 24). This is standard practice for module-specific loggers.
*   **Input Data Keys:** The functions implicitly expect specific keys in the input forecast dictionaries (e.g., `trace_id`, `parent_id`, `arc_label`, `rule_id`). While not hardcoded string literals scattered everywhere, this defines a rigid input structure. If the data schema changes, the module will require updates. This is more of an implicit contract.
*   **Output Summary Keys:** The [`lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:81-86) function produces a dictionary with fixed keys (`"generations"`, `"rule_recurrence"`, `"arc_map"`, `"total_forecasts"`). Consumers of this summary rely on these specific keys.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Input Data Schema:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected structure and key names of the input forecast JSON objects. Any changes to this schema in the data-producing part of the system would necessitate modifications in this module.
*   **CLI Arguments:** The CLI functionality is coupled to the `argparse` library and specifically expects a `--file` argument.
*   **Output Summary Structure:** Downstream systems or analyses consuming the output of [`lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77) are coupled to the specific keys and structure of the returned dictionary.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   There is one inline test function: [`_test_lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:91).
*   **Nature:** It's a very basic test that uses a small, hardcoded list of dummy forecast data. It calls the main [`lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77) function and makes a single assertion on the `total_forecasts` field in the output. It prints a success message to the console rather than integrating with a formal test runner.
*   **Coverage:** Extremely limited. It only tests one specific scenario for the main summary function. Individual helper functions like [`build_lineage_tree()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:26), [`group_by_generation()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:37), etc., are not directly and independently tested with varied inputs or edge cases (e.g., empty forecast list, forecasts with missing optional keys, very deep lineages).
*   **Gaps:**
    *   No dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/test_pulse_lineage_tracker.py`).
    *   Lack of use of a standard testing framework (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest`).
    *   Insufficient testing of edge cases, error conditions (e.g., invalid input file format for CLI), or different data configurations.
    *   The recursive nature of the `depth` calculation within [`group_by_generation()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:43) is not specifically stress-tested.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module follows a functional programming paradigm, consisting of a set of data transformation and analysis functions. It does not define any classes.
*   **Key Components:**
    1.  **Data Input (CLI):** Reads forecast data from a JSONL file.
    2.  **Core Logic Functions:**
        *   [`build_lineage_tree()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:26): Constructs parent-child relationships.
        *   [`group_by_generation()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:37): Determines generation depth for each forecast.
        *   [`arc_evolution_map()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:56): Tracks changes in `arc_label`s from parents to children.
        *   [`rule_recurrence_chain()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:67): Counts occurrences of `rule_id`s.
    3.  **Summary Aggregation:** [`lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77) combines the outputs of the core logic functions into a single summary dictionary.
    4.  **Output (CLI):** Prints the summary dictionary as a JSON string.
*   **Primary Data/Control Flow:**
    1.  A list of forecast dictionaries serves as the primary input.
    2.  [`lineage_trace_summary()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77) is the main entry point for analysis.
    3.  It calls the helper functions ([`group_by_generation()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:37), [`arc_evolution_map()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:56), [`rule_recurrence_chain()`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:67)) with the forecast list.
    4.  The results from these helpers are structured into a final summary dictionary.
    5.  If run via CLI, this summary is then serialized to JSON and printed. Logging calls are made at various points to indicate progress.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Adhere to PEP 8 `snake_case` (e.g., [`build_lineage_tree`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:26), [`lineage_trace_summary`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:77)). The internal test function [`_test_lineage_trace_summary`](trust_system/pulse_lineage_tracker.py:91) uses a leading underscore, which is a common convention for internal-use functions.
*   **Variables:** Mostly `snake_case` (e.g., `forecasts`, `id_to_forecast`, `arc_map`). Short, conventional variable names like `f` (for forecast), `k` (key), `v` (value) are used in loops and comprehensions, which is acceptable.
*   **Constants/Logger:** The logger instance `logger` is lowercase, which is standard.
*   **Consistency:** Naming is generally consistent and descriptive throughout the module.
*   **PEP 8 Adherence:** The module largely follows PEP 8 guidelines for naming.
*   **AI Assumption Errors:** The docstring mentions "Author: Pulse AI Engine" (line 16). If AI-generated, the naming is quite idiomatic and Pythonic, showing no obvious signs of non-human or awkward naming choices.
