# Module Analysis: `memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:) module is to select high-quality forecasts based on a set of predefined criteria and then export these "promoted" forecasts to a persistent memory file. This acts as a filter to ensure only reliable and trusted forecasts are retained for long-term use.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears functionally complete for its defined scope. It includes:
*   Logic for selecting forecasts ([`select_promotable_forecasts()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:22)).
*   A function to export the selected forecasts to a file ([`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53)).
*   A basic inline test function ([`_test_forecast_memory_promoter()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:64)) for a quick sanity check.

No obvious placeholders (e.g., `TODO`, `FIXME`) are present in the core logic.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Configuration:** Thresholds for `alignment_score` (currently `75`) and `confidence` (currently `0.85`) are hardcoded. These could be made configurable.
*   **Error Handling:** The error handling in [`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53) is generic (`except Exception as e`). More specific exception handling could improve robustness.
*   **Input Validation:** The module assumes the input `forecasts` to [`select_promotable_forecasts()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:22) is either a list of dictionaries or an object with an `_memory` attribute containing such a list. More explicit type checking or validation could be added.
*   **File Handling:** The [`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53) function currently overwrites the memory file (`"w"` mode). An option to append to the file might be a useful future enhancement, depending on the use case.
*   **"Fork Winner" Logic:** The meaning and determination of `fork_winner` are external to this module. Its integration is based on a boolean flag.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None are directly visible within this file. It's likely that the forecast data structures it processes are defined elsewhere in the project.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `json`: For serializing forecast data to JSON format.
    *   `logging`: For logging information and errors.
    *   `typing`: For type hints (`List`, `Dict`).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   Writes to the file specified by `MEMORY_PATH`, by default [`memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl`](../../../memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl:). This file is presumably read by other modules that consume promoted forecasts.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Output:** [`memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl`](../../../memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl:) (default path).
    *   **Input:** Forecast data structures passed as arguments to its functions. The format of these structures is implicitly defined by the keys accessed (e.g., `certified`, `license_status`).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### [`select_promotable_forecasts(forecasts)`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:22)

Selects forecasts that meet specific quality criteria.

```python
# Example Data
forecast_data_list = [
    {"id": "fc1", "certified": True, "license_status": "âœ… Approved", "trust_label": "ðŸŸ¢ Trusted", "symbolic_fragmented": False, "alignment_score": 80, "fork_winner": True, "confidence": 0.9},
    {"id": "fc2", "certified": True, "license_status": "âœ… Approved", "trust_label": "ðŸŸ¢ Trusted", "symbolic_fragmented": False, "alignment_score": 70, "fork_winner": False, "confidence": 0.9}, # Fails alignment_score
    {"id": "fc3", "certified": False, "license_status": "âœ… Approved", "trust_label": "ðŸŸ¢ Trusted", "symbolic_fragmented": False, "alignment_score": 90, "fork_winner": True, "confidence": 0.9}  # Fails certified
]

promotable = select_promotable_forecasts(forecast_data_list)
# promotable will be:
# [
#     {"id": "fc1", "certified": True, "license_status": "âœ… Approved", "trust_label": "ðŸŸ¢ Trusted", "symbolic_fragmented": False, "alignment_score": 80, "fork_winner": True, "confidence": 0.9}
# ]
```

### [`export_promoted(forecasts: List[Dict], path: str = MEMORY_PATH)`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53)

Saves the selected list of forecasts to a JSONL file.

```python
selected_forecasts = [
    {"id": "fc1", "certified": True, "license_status": "âœ… Approved", "trust_label": "ðŸŸ¢ Trusted", "symbolic_fragmented": False, "alignment_score": 80, "fork_winner": True, "confidence": 0.9}
]

# Assuming MEMORY_PATH = "memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl"
export_promoted(selected_forecasts)
# This will write the content of selected_forecasts to memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **File Path:** `MEMORY_PATH = "memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl"` ([`memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:17`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:17)) hardcodes the default output file path. While it can be overridden in [`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53), the default is fixed.
*   **Status Strings (Magic Strings):**
    *   `"âœ… Approved"` for `license_status` ([`memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:43`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:43))
    *   `"ðŸŸ¢ Trusted"` for `trust_label` ([`memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:44`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:44))
*   **Threshold Values (Magic Numbers):**
    *   `alignment_score >= 75` ([`memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:46`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:46))
    *   `confidence > 0.85` ([`memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:48`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:48))

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Data Structure Coupling:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected dictionary structure of forecasts. Changes to keys like `certified`, `license_status`, `trust_label`, `symbolic_fragmented`, `alignment_score`, `fork_winner`, or `confidence` in the input data would require modifications to this module.
*   **Output Format Coupling:** It's coupled to the output format (JSONL) and the default storage location ([`memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl`](../../../memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl:)).
*   **Implicit Contract:** Relies on an implicit contract for the meaning and source of boolean flags like `certified` and `fork_winner`, and string values for `license_status` and `trust_label`.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   An inline test function [`_test_forecast_memory_promoter()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:64) is present. This test is basic and primarily serves as a smoke test for the [`select_promotable_forecasts()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:22) function.
*   It's executed when the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
*   There is no indication of a separate, more comprehensive test suite file (e.g., `tests/test_forecast_memory_promoter.py`) from the provided context. Such a file would typically contain more extensive test cases, including edge cases and tests for the [`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53) function.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Input:** The module receives a list of forecast dictionaries (or an object that wraps such a list).
2.  **Selection ([`select_promotable_forecasts()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:22)):**
    *   Iterates through each forecast.
    *   Checks if `certified` is `True`.
    *   Checks if `license_status` is `"âœ… Approved"`.
    *   Checks if `trust_label` is `"ðŸŸ¢ Trusted"`.
    *   Checks if `symbolic_fragmented` is `False` (or not present/`None`).
    *   Checks if `alignment_score` is `>= 75`.
    *   If all above are true, it further checks if `fork_winner` is `True` OR `confidence` is `> 0.85`.
    *   Forecasts meeting all criteria are added to a `selected` list.
3.  **Export ([`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53)):**
    *   The `selected` list of forecasts is passed to this function.
    *   It opens the target file (default: [`memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl`](../../../memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl:)) in write mode (`"w"`), overwriting any existing content.
    *   Each forecast dictionary in the list is serialized to a JSON string and written as a new line in the file.
    *   Logs success or failure of the operation.
4.  **Execution:** The module can be run as a script, which will execute the [`_test_forecast_memory_promoter()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:64) function.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Module Name:** `forecast_memory_promoter.py` is descriptive and follows Python conventions.
*   **Functions:** [`select_promotable_forecasts()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:22), [`export_promoted()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:53), [`_test_forecast_memory_promoter()`](../../../memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:64) use snake_case, which is PEP 8 compliant. The leading underscore in `_test_forecast_memory_promoter` suggests an internal/utility function.
*   **Constants:** `MEMORY_PATH` is in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, appropriate for constants.
*   **Variables:** `logger`, `forecasts`, `selected`, `fc` (short for forecast_item) are generally clear and follow snake_case or are understandably short for loop variables.
*   **String Content:** The use of emojis (`"âœ… Approved"`, `"ðŸŸ¢ Trusted"`) within string literals for status checks is unconventional for core logic. While visually distinct, it might be better to use plain string constants or enums, with emojis reserved for UI layers if needed. This could be an AI assumption error if the system is expected to parse or generate these emojis based on other inputs.
*   Overall, naming is largely consistent with PEP 8.
