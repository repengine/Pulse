# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:1) module is to track the frequency of symbolic tags over time. This tracking is intended for bias analysis, allowing users to understand the distribution and prevalence of different symbolic tags encountered by the system. It provides functionality to record tags, export the frequency data to a CSV file, and visualize these frequencies as a bar plot.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its stated core purpose:
- It can record tags and update counts.
- It can export these counts to a CSV file.
- It can generate a basic bar plot of tag frequencies.

There are no explicit "TODO" comments or obvious placeholders for core functionality. Error handling is present for file operations and optional plotting library import.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Untapped History:** The `self.history` list ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:25`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:25)) stores the sequence of tags as they are recorded. However, this historical data is not currently utilized beyond being populated. It could be leveraged for more detailed temporal analysis, such as tracking tag frequency changes over specific periods or identifying trends, rather than just cumulative counts.
- **Data Persistence/Loading:** While tags are logged to `BIAS_LOG_PATH` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:20`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:20)), there's no mechanism to load or re-initialize the tracker's state from this log file or any other persisted state. Each instantiation of `SymbolicBiasTracker` starts fresh.
- **Reset Functionality:** No method is provided to reset the counter or history within an existing tracker instance.
- **Advanced Plotting:** The plotting functionality ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:47`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:47)) is basic. If timestamps were recorded with tags, time-series plots or more sophisticated visualizations could offer deeper insights into bias evolution.
- **Configuration for Log/CSV:** While `BIAS_LOG_PATH` is configurable via `PATHS`, the CSV export path has a hardcoded default within the method signature.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from other project modules:
- [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](../../../core/path_registry.py): Used to determine the path for the bias log file ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:17`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:17)).

### External Library Dependencies:
- `json`: Used for serializing data written to the log file ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:14`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:14)).
- `collections.Counter`: Used for efficiently counting tag frequencies ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:15`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:15)).
- `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`: Used for type hinting ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:16`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:16)).
- `csv`: Used for exporting data to a CSV file (imported within the `export_csv` method) ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:40`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:40)).
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Used for plotting tag frequencies (optional, imported within the `plot_frequencies` method) ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:49`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:49)).

### Interaction with other modules via shared data:
- The module writes to a JSONL log file whose path is determined by `PATHS.get("SYMBOLIC_BIAS_LOG", "logs/symbolic_bias_log.jsonl")` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:20`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:20)). Other modules could potentially read this file, though the tracker itself doesn't currently read from it to restore state.

### Input/Output Files:
- **Output Log File:** Appends to `logs/symbolic_bias_log.jsonl` (by default) in JSON Lines format. Each line is a JSON object like `{"tag": "TagName"}`.
- **Output CSV File:** Creates or overwrites a CSV file (default: `symbolic_bias.csv`) during the `export_csv` operation ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:39`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:39)).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module's docstring provides a clear usage example:

```python
from symbolic_system.symbolic_bias_tracker import SymbolicBiasTracker

# Initialize the tracker
tracker = SymbolicBiasTracker()

# Record some symbolic tags
tracker.record("Hope Rising")
tracker.record("Fear Dominant")
tracker.record("Hope Rising") # Record again

# Get current frequencies
frequencies = tracker.get_frequencies()
print(frequencies)  # Output: {'Hope Rising': 2, 'Fear Dominant': 1}

# Export frequencies to a CSV file
tracker.export_csv("bias_report.csv")

# Plot frequencies (requires matplotlib)
tracker.plot_frequencies()
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Log File Path Default:** The default path for the bias log is hardcoded as `"logs/symbolic_bias_log.jsonl"` if `SYMBOLIC_BIAS_LOG` is not found in `PATHS` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:20`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:20)).
- **CSV Export Path Default:** The default filename for CSV export is hardcoded as `"symbolic_bias.csv"` within the `export_csv` method signature ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:39`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:39)).
- **Plotting Details:**
    - Plot title: `"Symbolic Tag Frequencies"` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:52`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:52)).
    - X-axis label: `"Tag"` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:53`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:53)).
    - Y-axis label: `"Count"` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:54`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:54)).
    These are not configurable without modifying the code.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **`core.path_registry`:** The module is coupled to the [`core.path_registry`](../../../core/path_registry.py) for resolving the `SYMBOLIC_BIAS_LOG` path. Changes to `PATHS` or its structure could affect the logger.
- **File System:** Directly interacts with the file system for logging ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:31`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:31)) and CSV export ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:41`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_bias_tracker.py:41)). Assumes write permissions to the specified paths.
- **`matplotlib` (Optional):** The plotting functionality depends on `matplotlib` being installed. If not, it prints a message and skips plotting.

## 8. Existing Tests

- No specific test file (e.g., `tests/symbolic_system/test_symbolic_bias_tracker.py`) was found during the analysis of the `tests/symbolic_system/` directory.
- This indicates a gap in unit testing for this module. Tests should cover tag recording, frequency calculation, CSV export format and content, and potentially the logging mechanism. Plotting could be tested by checking if `matplotlib` functions are called, or by mocking `plt.show()`.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module defines a single class, `SymbolicBiasTracker`.

- **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    - Creates an empty `collections.Counter` instance (`self.counter`) to store tag frequencies.
    - Creates an empty list (`self.history`) to store the sequence of recorded tags.
- **Recording (`record(tag: str)`)**:
    - Increments the count for the given `tag` in `self.counter`.
    - Appends the `tag` to `self.history`.
    - Opens the `BIAS_LOG_PATH` file in append mode (`"a"`) and writes the tag as a JSON object on a new line (e.g., `{"tag": "some_tag"}\n`).
    - Includes basic error handling for the file write operation.
- **Getting Frequencies (`get_frequencies() -> Dict[str, int]`)**:
    - Returns the current state of `self.counter` as a standard dictionary.
- **Exporting CSV (`export_csv(csv_path="symbolic_bias.csv")`)**:
    - Imports the `csv` module.
    - Opens the specified `csv_path` in write mode (`"w"`).
    - Writes a header row `["tag", "count"]`.
    - Iterates through `self.counter.items()` and writes each tag and its count as a row.
- **Plotting Frequencies (`plot_frequencies()`)**:
    - Attempts to import `matplotlib.pyplot`. If `ImportError`, prints a message and exits.
    - Extracts tags and counts from `self.counter.items()`.
    - Creates a bar chart using `plt.bar()`.
    - Sets the title, labels, and rotates x-axis labels for better readability.
    - Calls `plt.tight_layout()` and `plt.show()` to display the plot.
    - Includes basic error handling for plotting.

The primary data flow involves:
1. External systems or other parts of the application calling `tracker.record(tag)` with symbolic tags.
2. These tags update the in-memory `Counter` and `history` list.
3. Tags are simultaneously appended to the `BIAS_LOG_PATH` file.
4. On demand, `get_frequencies`, `export_csv`, or `plot_frequencies` can be called to access or visualize the aggregated counts.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Class Name:** `SymbolicBiasTracker` is descriptive and follows PascalCase, consistent with Python conventions.
- **Method Names:** `record`, `get_frequencies`, `export_csv`, `plot_frequencies` are clear, action-oriented, and use snake_case.
- **Constant:** `BIAS_LOG_PATH` is in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, which is appropriate for module-level constants.
- **Variables:** Local variables like `tag`, `count`, `writer`, `tags`, `counts` are clear and use snake_case.
- **Docstrings:** The module has a docstring explaining its purpose and usage. Methods also have brief docstrings or are self-explanatory.
- **Type Hinting:** Type hints are used for method signatures, improving readability and maintainability.

The naming conventions are generally consistent and adhere to PEP 8. There are no obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations from standard Python practices.
