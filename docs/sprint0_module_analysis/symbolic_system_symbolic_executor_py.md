# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:) module is to apply symbolic upgrade plans to active forecasts. This involves:
- Replacing symbolic arcs and tags within forecasts based on predefined upgrade maps.
- Rewriting symbolic overlays in memory (by modifying forecast dictionaries).
- Tracking the lineage of these symbolic transformations by generating and logging mutation traces.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears relatively complete for its defined scope. It includes core functions for applying upgrades, rewriting forecasts in batches, generating traces, and logging mutations. A basic inline test function, [`_test_symbolic_executor()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:101), exists to verify fundamental functionality. There are no explicit "TODO" comments or obvious major placeholders in the provided code, suggesting the core features are implemented as intended for version 1.0.0.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **"Boost" Functionality:** The docstring for [`apply_symbolic_upgrade()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:23) mentions that the `upgrade_map` can contain a `"boost"` list, but this key is not actually used in the function's logic. This suggests an intended feature for boosting certain symbols (perhaps by adjusting confidence or priority) that was not implemented or was deferred.
-   **Dependency on `upgrade_planner`:** The module relies on an `upgrade_plan` (specifically its `suggestions` key) which is expected to be generated by an external "upgrade_planner" module, as mentioned in the docstring for [`rewrite_forecast_symbolics()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:51). The specifics of this planner and the full structure of the `upgrade_plan` are not detailed within this module, indicating a dependency that might require further exploration for a complete understanding.
-   **Generic Error Handling:** The error handling in [`log_symbolic_mutation()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:85) uses a generic `except Exception as e:`. More specific exception handling (e.g., for `IOError`, `PermissionError`) could improve robustness.
-   **Configuration of Replacements:** The replacement values `"Stabilization"` and `"Narrative Convergence"` are hardcoded. Future enhancements might involve making these configurable.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

-   **Direct Project Module Imports:** None explicitly shown, but it's designed to operate on `forecast` objects and `upgrade_plan` objects that likely originate from other modules within the `symbolic_system` or broader project.
-   **External Library Dependencies:**
    -   `json`: Used for deep copying forecast objects and for serializing trace logs.
    -   `logging`: Used for standard logging.
    -   `typing` (`Dict`, `List`): Used for type hinting.
-   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    -   Operates on `forecast` dictionaries, which are presumably passed from other parts of the system.
    -   Receives `upgrade_map` and `upgrade_plan` dictionaries, likely from a planning or strategy module.
-   **Input/Output Files:**
    -   **Output:** Logs symbolic mutation traces to a JSONL file, defaulting to [`logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl`](../../../logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

-   **[`apply_symbolic_upgrade(forecast: Dict, upgrade_map: Dict) -> Dict`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:23):**
    -   **Purpose:** Modifies a single forecast dictionary based on the `upgrade_map`. If the forecast's `symbolic_tag` or `arc_label` is in the `replace_or_retrain` list of the `upgrade_map`, it's replaced with "Stabilization" or "Narrative Convergence", respectively.
    -   **Usage:**
        ```python
        forecast = {"trace_id": "t1", "arc_label": "Old Arc", "symbolic_tag": "Old Tag"}
        upgrade_map = {"replace_or_retrain": ["Old Arc", "Old Tag"]}
        mutated_forecast = apply_symbolic_upgrade(forecast, upgrade_map)
        # mutated_forecast will have 'arc_label' as "Narrative Convergence"
        # and 'symbolic_tag' as "Stabilization"
        ```

-   **[`rewrite_forecast_symbolics(forecasts: List[Dict], upgrade_plan: Dict) -> List[Dict]`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:51):**
    -   **Purpose:** Applies symbolic upgrades to a batch (list) of forecasts using an `upgrade_plan`.
    -   **Usage:**
        ```python
        forecast_list = [
            {"trace_id": "t1", "arc_label": "RiskA", "symbolic_tag": "Concern"},
            {"trace_id": "t2", "arc_label": "OpportunityX", "symbolic_tag": "Hope"}
        ]
        plan = {"suggestions": {"replace_or_retrain": ["RiskA", "Concern"]}}
        revised_list = rewrite_forecast_symbolics(forecast_list, plan)
        # The first forecast in revised_list will be modified.
        ```

-   **[`generate_upgrade_trace(original: Dict, mutated: Dict) -> Dict`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:68):**
    -   **Purpose:** Creates a dictionary summarizing the changes made to a forecast's symbolic fields.
    -   **Usage:**
        ```python
        original_fc = {"trace_id": "t1", "arc_label": "Old Arc", "symbolic_tag": "Old Tag"}
        mutated_fc = {"trace_id": "t1", "arc_label": "New Arc", "symbolic_tag": "New Tag", "symbolic_mutation": {"arc": "Old Arc -> New Arc"}}
        trace = generate_upgrade_trace(original_fc, mutated_fc)
        # trace will contain before/after values for arc and tag, and mutation details.
        ```

-   **[`log_symbolic_mutation(trace: Dict, path: str = "logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl")`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:85):**
    -   **Purpose:** Appends a symbolic mutation trace record to a specified JSONL file.
    -   **Usage:**
        ```python
        # Assuming 'trace' is a dictionary from generate_upgrade_trace()
        log_symbolic_mutation(trace)
        # This will append the trace to "logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl"
        ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Replacement Strings:**
    -   `"Stabilization"` is hardcoded as the replacement for `symbolic_tag` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:40`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:40)).
    -   `"Narrative Convergence"` is hardcoded as the replacement for `arc_label` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:44`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:44)).
-   **Mutation Type:**
    -   `"symbolic_upgrade"` is hardcoded as the `mutation_type` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:47`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:47)).
-   **Default Log Path:**
    -   The default path for the mutation log is hardcoded as [`"logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl"`](logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl) in the [`log_symbolic_mutation()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:85) function signature.
-   **Default Trace ID:**
    -   If a `trace_id` is not found in the original forecast, `"unknown"` is used as a default in [`generate_upgrade_trace()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:76).

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **Forecast Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected dictionary structure of `forecast` objects. It specifically accesses keys like `"symbolic_tag"`, `"arc_label"`, and `"trace_id"`, and adds/modifies `"symbolic_mutation"` and `"mutation_type"`. Changes to this structure elsewhere could break this module.
-   **Upgrade Plan/Map Structure:** It depends on the structure of the `upgrade_map` (expecting `"replace_or_retrain"`) and `upgrade_plan` (expecting a `"suggestions"` key which contains an `upgrade_map`).
-   **External `upgrade_planner`:** The quality and nature of the symbolic upgrades are entirely dependent on the `upgrade_plan` provided by an external (and not detailed here) `upgrade_planner` module.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   **Inline Tests:** A basic test function [`_test_symbolic_executor()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:101) is included within the module itself. This test covers a simple scenario for [`apply_symbolic_upgrade()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:23) and [`generate_upgrade_trace()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:68), asserting expected output values.
-   **External Test Files:** Based on the provided file listing, there does not appear to be a dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/symbolic_system/test_symbolic_executor.py`).
-   **Coverage & Nature:** The existing inline test is minimal and primarily serves as a basic sanity check. It does not cover edge cases, error conditions, or interactions with the file system (logging).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

-   **Functional Approach:** The module consists of a set of standalone functions.
-   **Core Logic (`apply_symbolic_upgrade`)**:
    1.  Takes a `forecast` dictionary and an `upgrade_map`.
    2.  Creates a deep copy of the forecast.
    3.  Checks if the forecast's `symbolic_tag` is in the `upgrade_map`'s `replace_or_retrain` list. If so, updates `symbolic_tag` to "Stabilization" and records the change in `symbolic_mutation`.
    4.  Similarly, checks and updates `arc_label` to "Narrative Convergence".
    5.  Sets `mutation_type` to "symbolic_upgrade".
    6.  Returns the revised forecast.
-   **Batch Processing (`rewrite_forecast_symbolics`)**:
    1.  Iterates through a list of `forecasts`.
    2.  Calls [`apply_symbolic_upgrade()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:23) for each forecast using the `suggestions` from the `upgrade_plan`.
    3.  Collects and returns the list of revised forecasts.
-   **Tracing and Logging**:
    -   [`generate_upgrade_trace()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:68) compiles a dictionary detailing the "before" and "after" states of symbolic fields.
    -   [`log_symbolic_mutation()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:85) appends this trace to a JSONL file.
-   **Control Flow:** The primary control flow for batch operations is `rewrite_forecast_symbolics` -> `apply_symbolic_upgrade`. Tracing and logging are separate utility functions.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Functions and Variables:** Generally follow PEP 8 standards (e.g., `snake_case` for functions and variables like [`apply_symbolic_upgrade`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:23), `upgrade_map`).
-   **Logger Name:** The logger is named `"symbolic_executor"`, which is clear and consistent with the module's name.
-   **Abbreviations:** `fc` is used as a variable name for `forecast` within a loop in [`rewrite_forecast_symbolics()`](../../../symbolic_system/symbolic_executor.py:51). While short, it's a common practice and understandable in context.
-   **Clarity:** Names like `revised`, `original`, `mutated`, `upgrade_map`, `upgrade_plan` are descriptive.
-   **Consistency:** Consistent use of terms like "symbolic", "upgrade", "mutation", "trace".
-   **AI Assumption Errors:** No obvious errors in naming that would suggest misinterpretation by an AI or significant deviation from common Python practices.
