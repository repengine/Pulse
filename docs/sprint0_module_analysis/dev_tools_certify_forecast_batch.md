# Module Analysis: `dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py`

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-15

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The module [`dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:1) is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to process a batch of forecasts, mark them according to Pulse certification standards, and then export the set of certified forecasts. Optionally, it can also generate and print a summary report (digest) of the certification results.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

-   **Operational:** The module appears to be operational for its defined tasks: loading a forecast batch, tagging forecasts based on certification criteria (delegated), saving the tagged batch, and optionally generating/printing a summary.
-   **Completeness:**
    -   The core workflow is implemented.
    -   It uses helper functions [`load_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17) and [`save_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:21) for file I/O.
    -   The actual certification logic and digest generation are delegated to functions ([`tag_certified_forecasts`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:13), [`generate_certified_digest`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:14)) imported from [`forecast_output.forecast_fidelity_certifier`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:1).

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **Error Handling:** The script lacks explicit error handling for file operations within [`load_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17) and [`save_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:21) (e.g., `try-except` blocks for `FileNotFoundError`, `IOError`, `JSONDecodeError`). If the imported functions ([`tag_certified_forecasts`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:13), [`generate_certified_digest`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:14)) raise exceptions, they are not caught at the script level, which could lead to ungraceful termination.
-   **Configuration:** File paths and the summary flag are managed via CLI arguments. No support for configuration files.
-   **Output Flexibility:** The summary report is printed to `stdout` as a JSON string. There's no option to save this report to a file directly via a CLI argument.
-   **Logging:** Beyond the optional summary printout, there's no other logging (e.g., number of forecasts processed, number certified, errors encountered).

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

-   **Internal Dependencies:**
    -   [`forecast_output.forecast_fidelity_certifier`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:1): Imports [`tag_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:13) and [`generate_certified_digest()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:14). This is a critical dependency for its core functionality.
-   **Standard Library Dependencies:**
    -   `argparse`: For command-line argument parsing.
    -   `json`: For loading and dumping JSON/JSONL data.
-   **External Data:**
    -   Relies on an input forecast batch file (JSONL format).
    -   Produces an output file with tagged forecasts (JSONL format).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module is primarily used as a CLI tool.

**CLI Usage Example:**

```bash
# Certify forecasts and save the tagged batch
python dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py --batch path/to/input_forecasts.jsonl --export path/to/certified_output.jsonl

# Certify, save, and print summary report
python dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py --batch path/to/input_forecasts.jsonl --export path/to/certified_output.jsonl --summary
```
If `--export` is not specified, it defaults to `certified_forecasts.jsonl`.

The script defines two helper functions:
-   [`load_jsonl(path)`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17): Loads a JSONL file into a list of dictionaries.
-   [`save_jsonl(batch, path)`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:21): Saves a list of dictionaries to a JSONL file.

These are used internally and are not designed for external import as primary module functionality.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Default Output Filename:** The default export path is hardcoded to `"certified_forecasts.jsonl"` in the `argparse` setup ([`parser.add_argument("--export", default="certified_forecasts.jsonl")`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:28)). This is overridable.
-   No critical hardcoding of secrets or API keys was observed.
-   The summary report format (JSON dump with indent 2) is hardcoded.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **High Coupling:** Tightly coupled to the API and expected behavior of [`tag_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:13) and [`generate_certified_digest()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:14) from [`forecast_output.forecast_fidelity_certifier`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:1).
-   **Data Format Coupling:** Tightly coupled to the expected JSONL structure for input and output forecasts.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   No dedicated unit tests or integration tests were found within the project structure for this specific module.
-   The module itself does not contain inline tests.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

-   **Architecture:** Simple, linear script.
    -   Defines helper functions for JSONL loading and saving.
    -   Parses CLI arguments.
    -   Loads input batch using [`load_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17).
    -   Calls [`tag_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:13) to process the forecasts.
    -   Saves the tagged batch using [`save_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:21).
    -   If `--summary` is specified, calls [`generate_certified_digest()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:14) and prints the report.
-   **Flow:**
    1.  Define `argparse` arguments: `--batch` (required), `--export` (default: "certified_forecasts.jsonl"), `--summary` (flag).
    2.  Parse arguments.
    3.  Load forecasts from the file specified by `args.batch` using [`load_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17).
    4.  Pass the loaded `forecasts` to [`tag_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:13) to get the `tagged` batch.
    5.  Save the `tagged` batch to the file specified by `args.export` using [`save_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:21).
    6.  If `args.summary` is true:
        a.  Generate a report from the `tagged` batch using [`generate_certified_digest()`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:14).
        b.  Print the report to `stdout` as a formatted JSON string.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   Python naming conventions (snake_case for functions and variables) are generally followed (e.g., [`load_jsonl`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17), `tag_certified_forecasts`, `args.batch`).
-   Variable names are clear and descriptive.

## 11. SPARC Analysis

-   **Specification:** The module's intent as a CLI for certifying forecast batches is clear from its docstring and arguments.
-   **Project Context & Understanding:** It serves as a utility within a larger forecasting system, specifically for quality assurance or filtering based on "Pulse certification standards."
-   **Architecture Adherence:** Standard utility script architecture, delegating core logic.
-   **Modularity:**
    -   Good: Certification and digest logic are imported from [`forecast_output.forecast_fidelity_certifier`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:1), promoting separation of concerns.
    -   Helper functions [`load_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:17) and [`save_jsonl()`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:21) are simple and could be part of a shared utility library if this pattern is common.
-   **Maintainability:**
    -   The script is short and straightforward, making it relatively easy to understand.
    -   The lack of error handling in file I/O and around calls to external functions reduces robustness and could make debugging harder.
    -   Absence of tests makes refactoring or verifying changes riskier.
-   **Testability:**
    -   Poor: No dedicated tests.
    -   The script's core logic (after argument parsing) could be encapsulated in a main function and tested by mocking file I/O and the imported `forecast_fidelity_certifier` functions.
-   **Security:** No direct handling of sensitive information. Assumes input files are trusted.
-   **Hardcoding:** Default output filename is hardcoded but configurable. No critical hardcoding.
-   **Clarity & Readability:** Good. The script is concise and its purpose is clear.
-   **Error Handling:** Lacking. The script relies on Python's default behavior for I/O errors (which would terminate the script) and does not explicitly handle exceptions from the imported certification functions.

## Summary Note for Main Report

The [`dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py`](dev_tools/certify_forecast_batch.py:1) module is a CLI tool that tags forecasts in a batch according to certification standards and exports the results, optionally providing a summary digest. It relies on [`forecast_output.forecast_fidelity_certifier`](forecast_output/forecast_fidelity_certifier.py:1) for its core logic, but lacks robust error handling and dedicated tests.
