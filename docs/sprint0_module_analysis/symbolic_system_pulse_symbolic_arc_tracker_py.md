# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py`

**Version:** v0.1.0
**Author:** Pulse AI Engine

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

This module is designed to track, analyze, and visualize the distribution and changes of "symbolic arcs" within batches of forecasts. Its core responsibilities include:
- Counting the frequency of different symbolic arc labels.
- Comparing arc distributions between different forecast batches to identify "drift."
- Calculating an overall arc stability score based on drift.
- Exporting analysis summaries to JSON files.
- Generating bar plots of arc distributions using `matplotlib`.
- Assigning symbolic arc labels to forecasts based on their `symbolic_tag`.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

- The module appears to be in an early but functional state (v0.1.0) for its defined scope.
- All listed features (arc counting, drift comparison, stability scoring, export, plotting) have corresponding implemented functions:
    - [`track_symbolic_arcs()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23)
    - [`compare_arc_drift()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:40)
    - [`compute_arc_stability()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:66)
    - [`export_arc_summary()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:81)
    - [`plot_arc_distribution()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:97)
    - [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125)
- Basic error handling (try-except blocks) is present for file export and plotting operations.
- No explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders were found in the provided code.
- The logic for assigning arc labels in [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) is based on a fixed set of keywords, which might be an area for future enhancement.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Configurable Arc Labeling:** The [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) function uses hardcoded keywords (`"hope"`, `"despair"`, etc.) and corresponding arc labels. This could be made more flexible by allowing configuration via external files or parameters.
- **Use of "Drivers" for Labeling:** The docstring for [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:127) mentions using `"symbolic_tag or drivers"` for labeling, but the implementation currently only uses `"symbolic_tag"`. The "drivers" aspect appears to be an unimplemented extension.
- **Advanced Analysis:**
    - The module could be extended with more sophisticated drift analysis, such as calculating statistical significance.
    - Tracking transitions between arc types across batches could provide deeper insights.
- **Integration:** While functional as a standalone utility, its integration into a larger symbolic analysis pipeline is implied but not defined within this module.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

- **Project-Internal Imports:** None observed in this module. It appears to be a self-contained utility.
- **External Library Dependencies:**
    - `json` (Python standard library): For exporting arc summaries.
    - `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, `typing.Optional` (Python standard library): For type hinting.
    - `collections.Counter` (Python standard library): For efficient frequency counting.
    - `matplotlib.pyplot` (External): Used for plotting arc distributions. This is an optional dependency in the sense that the module can perform other functions without it, but plotting will fail if it's not installed (though errors are caught).
    - `os` (Python standard library): Potentially used implicitly by `matplotlib` or file operations, though not directly called in the main logic apart from `open()`.
- **Data Interaction:**
    - **Input:** Expects a list of dictionaries (`forecasts`). Each dictionary is assumed to potentially contain an `"arc_label"` key (used by [`track_symbolic_arcs()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23)) or a `"symbolic_tag"` key (used by [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125)). The exact structure and origin of these forecast dictionaries are external to this module.
    - **Output:**
        - Dictionaries mapping arc labels to counts or drift percentages.
        - A float representing the arc stability score.
        - JSON files containing arc summaries ([`export_arc_summary()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:81)).
        - Image files (e.g., PNG) of plots if `export_path` is provided to [`plot_arc_distribution()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:97).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

(No classes are defined in this module.)

- **[`compute_arc_label(forecast: Dict) -> str`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125):**
  Assigns a symbolic arc label based on keywords in the forecast's `symbolic_tag`.
  ```python
  forecast_example = {"symbolic_tag": "Market shows strong hope for recovery"}
  label = compute_arc_label(forecast_example)
  # Expected: label = "arc_hope_recovery"
  ```

- **[`track_symbolic_arcs(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, int]`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23):**
  Counts occurrences of each `arc_label` in a list of forecasts.
  ```python
  forecast_batch = [
      {"arc_label": "arc_hope_recovery"},
      {"arc_label": "arc_stability"},
      {"arc_label": "arc_hope_recovery", "symbolic_tag": "hopeful sign"} # assuming arc_label is prioritized
  ]
  arc_counts = track_symbolic_arcs(forecast_batch)
  # Expected: arc_counts = {"arc_hope_recovery": 2, "arc_stability": 1}
  ```

- **[`compare_arc_drift(prev: List[Dict], curr: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, float]`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:40):**
  Calculates the percentage change in arc label frequencies between two forecast batches.
  ```python
  # To use compare_arc_drift directly:
  prev_forecasts = [{"arc_label": "A"}, {"arc_label": "B"}]
  curr_forecasts = [{"arc_label": "A"}, {"arc_label": "A"}, {"arc_label": "C"}]
  drift = compare_arc_drift(prev_forecasts, curr_forecasts)
  # Expected: drift = {'A': 100.0, 'B': -100.0, 'C': 100.0} (approx, depends on exact counts)
  ```

- **[`compute_arc_stability(drift: Dict[str, float]) -> float`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:66):**
  Calculates an overall stability score from a drift dictionary.
  ```python
  drift_data = {'A': 50.0, 'B': -20.0, 'C': 10.0}
  stability_score = compute_arc_stability(drift_data)
  # Expected: stability_score = 26.67
  ```

- **[`export_arc_summary(arc_counts: Dict[str, int], path: str) -> None`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:81):**
  Saves arc counts to a JSON file.
  ```python
  counts_to_export = {"arc_X": 150, "arc_Y": 75}
  export_arc_summary(counts_to_export, "reports/arc_summary_batch_1.json")
  # A JSON file will be created at the specified path.
  ```

- **[`plot_arc_distribution(arc_counts: Dict[str, int], title: Optional[str], export_path: Optional[str]) -> None`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:97):**
  Generates and optionally saves a bar plot of arc counts.
  ```python
  current_arc_counts = {"arc_positive": 120, "arc_negative": 30, "arc_neutral": 50}
  plot_arc_distribution(current_arc_counts, title="Current Arc Distribution", export_path="plots/current_arcs.png")
  # A plot image will be saved.
  ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Arc Labeling Logic ([`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125)):**
    - Keywords used for matching (e.g., `"hope"`, `"despair"`, `"rage"`, `"fatigue"`, `"trust"`) are hardcoded.
    - The resulting arc labels (e.g., `"arc_hope_recovery"`, `"arc_despair_decline"`) are hardcoded.
- **Default Values:**
    - If `arc_label` is missing in a forecast, [`track_symbolic_arcs()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:35) defaults to `"Unknown"`.
    - [`plot_arc_distribution()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:97) has hardcoded `figsize=(8, 4)`, `color="skyblue"`, `edgecolor="black"`, and a default title `"Symbolic Arc Distribution"`.
- **Numerical Constants:** The value `100.0` is used for percentage calculations in [`compare_arc_drift()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:60).
- **Output Messages:** Print statements for success/failure of export/plot operations (e.g., `"âœ… Arc summary exported to {path}"`) are hardcoded.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **Forecast Data Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected dictionary structure of input `forecasts`. It relies on the presence and semantics of keys like `"arc_label"` or `"symbolic_tag"`. Changes to this data structure elsewhere in the project would likely break this module.
- **[`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) Function:** This function is central to how arcs are defined and categorized. Any changes to the symbolic interpretation of forecasts would necessitate modifications here, impacting all downstream calculations.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`:** The plotting functionality depends directly on this external library.

## 8. Existing Tests

- No test files (e.g., `tests/symbolic_system/test_pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py`) were provided or are directly evident from the module's code alone.
- A dedicated test suite would be necessary to ensure the correctness of calculations (counts, drift, stability) and I/O operations, covering various scenarios and edge cases (e.g., empty forecast lists, forecasts with missing tags/labels, identical batches for drift calculation).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

- **Architecture:** The module consists of a set of stateless utility functions. It does not define any classes or maintain internal state beyond the scope of individual function calls.
- **Key Functional Components:**
    1.  **Label Assignment (Implicit/Explicit):** Forecasts are expected to have an `arc_label`, or one can be derived using [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) from a `symbolic_tag`.
    2.  **Frequency Counting:** [`track_symbolic_arcs()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23) tabulates these labels.
    3.  **Change Measurement:** [`compare_arc_drift()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:40) quantifies changes between two sets of counts.
    4.  **Stability Assessment:** [`compute_arc_stability()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:66) provides a single metric for overall change.
    5.  **Reporting:** [`export_arc_summary()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:81) (JSON) and [`plot_arc_distribution()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:97) (visual) provide outputs.
- **Primary Data Flow:**
    - Input: Raw forecast data (list of dictionaries).
    - Processing:
        - Forecasts -> Arc Labels (via `get("arc_label")` or potentially [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) if used as a pre-processor).
        - Arc Labels -> Arc Counts ([`track_symbolic_arcs()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23)).
        - Arc Counts (current & previous) -> Arc Drift ([`compare_arc_drift()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:40)).
        - Arc Drift -> Stability Score ([`compute_arc_stability()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:66)).
    - Output: JSON summaries, plots, numerical scores.
- **Ambiguity in `compute_arc_label` usage:** The module provides [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) but [`track_symbolic_arcs()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23) directly uses `f.get("arc_label", "Unknown")`. This implies that `arc_label` might already be present in the input forecasts, or [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) is intended to be called by an upstream process to populate `arc_label` before this module's main tracking functions are used. If `symbolic_tag` is the primary source, a preprocessing step using [`compute_arc_label()`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:125) to create/update `arc_label` in the forecast dictionaries would make the flow clearer.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** Adhere to PEP 8 (e.g., [`track_symbolic_arcs`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:23), [`compute_arc_stability`](../../../symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_arc_tracker.py:66)). Names are generally descriptive.
- **Variables:** Mostly use snake_case (e.g., `arc_counts`, `prev_batch`, `safe_title`). Short, conventional variable names (`f`, `p`, `c`, `v`) are used appropriately within local scopes (loops, comprehensions).
- **Strings:** Symbolic arc labels themselves (e.g., `"arc_hope_recovery"`, `"arc_unknown"`) follow a `category_descriptor` pattern using snake_case.
- **Consistency:** Naming is consistent throughout the module.
- **PEP 8 Adherence:** The code largely follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
- **Potential AI Influence:** The "Author: Pulse AI Engine" suggests AI involvement. If so, the naming conventions are well-aligned with common Python practices. No obvious naming errors attributable to AI misinterpretation were noted.
