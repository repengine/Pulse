# Module Analysis: `scripts/build_symbol_index.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`scripts/build_symbol_index.py`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py) is to scan Python files within the Pulse codebase, extract information about defined symbols (specifically functions and classes), and then build two distinct index artifacts:

1.  **`symbol_index.json`**: A human-readable JSON file that provides a flat list of all extracted symbols, intended for quick searching (e.g., with `grep`) and debugging. ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:6`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:6), [`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:88`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:88))
2.  **`vstore/` (default path)**: A Chroma vector database containing embeddings of these symbols. This is likely used for more advanced semantic search capabilities or similarity analysis across the codebase. ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:5`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:5), [`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:115`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:115))

The script aims to provide an up-to-date index of code symbols to aid developers in understanding and navigating the codebase.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete and operational for its stated purpose.
- It handles command-line argument parsing for paths and API keys.
- It successfully scans specified directories for Python files.
- It uses Python's `ast` module to parse files and extract function/class definitions.
- It generates the `symbol_index.json` output.
- It interacts with ChromaDB to store symbol embeddings, with a fallback if an OpenAI API key is not provided.
- Basic error handling for `SyntaxError` during file parsing is present ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:35`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:35)).
- No obvious TODO comments or major placeholders were observed in the code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **Language Support Extensibility:** The script currently only supports Python files by using the `ast` module. The docstring mentions `tree_sitter_python` in the requirements ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:8`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:8)), which could imply an earlier intention or a potential future path to support more robust parsing or even other languages (as `tree-sitter` is a general parsing framework). However, the current implementation relies solely on `ast`.
-   **Configuration for `ALLOWED_DIRS`:** The list of directories to scan (`ALLOWED_DIRS`) is hardcoded ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:53-69`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:53-69)). This means the script needs manual updates if new primary source directories are added to the project. Externalizing this (e.g., via a configuration file or command-line argument) would improve flexibility.
-   **ChromaDB Update Strategy:** The script performs a full refresh of the ChromaDB collection by deleting and recreating it ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:103`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:103)). For very large codebases or frequent updates, an incremental update strategy might be more efficient, though the current approach ensures freshness.
-   **Embedding Text Detail:** The text used for generating embeddings is a simple concatenation of kind, name, and summary ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:111`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:111)). More sophisticated representations (e.g., including full docstrings or even code snippets) could be explored for potentially higher-quality embeddings, at the cost of increased complexity and embedding cost.
-   **Error Reporting:** While `SyntaxError` is caught, reporting on which files failed to parse or other potential issues could be more detailed.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

-   **[`extract_symbols(path: Path) -> List[Dict]`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:29):**
    -   **Description:** Reads a given Python file, parses its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and extracts details for each function (`FunctionDef`, `AsyncFunctionDef`) and class (`ClassDef`) definition. Details include name, kind, relative file path, line number, and a shortened docstring summary.
    -   **Conceptual Usage:** `symbol_list = extract_symbols(Path("my_module/my_file.py"))`
-   **[`main()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:71):**
    -   **Description:** Orchestrates the entire indexing process. It parses command-line arguments, identifies target Python files, iterates through them calling `extract_symbols`, saves the aggregated symbol data to `symbol_index.json`, and then, if an OpenAI API key is available, generates and stores embeddings in a ChromaDB collection.
    -   **CLI Usage Example (from docstring):**
        ```bash
        python scripts/build_symbol_index.py \
            --repo-path . \
            --db-path vstore \
            --openai-key $OPENAI_API_KEY
        ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **`ALLOWED_DIRS` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:53-69`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:53-69)):** A `set` of top-level directory names that are included in the scan. This is a primary point of hardcoding that would require script modification if new core source directories are added.
-   **Output Filename `symbol_index.json` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:88`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:88)):** The name of the JSON output file is fixed.
-   **ChromaDB Collection Name `"pulse-code-index"` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:98`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:98), [`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:103`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:103), [`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:105`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:105)): The name of the collection within ChromaDB is fixed.
-   **Docstring Summary Length `120` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:41`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:41)):** The maximum length for the docstring summary is hardcoded in the `textwrap.shorten` call.
-   **Default CLI Argument Values:**
    -   `--repo-path`: Defaults to `.` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:73`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:73)).
    -   `--db-path`: Defaults to `vstore` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:74`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:74)).
    -   `--batch`: Defaults to `128` ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:76`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:76)).
    (These are configurable via CLI, so less critical than `ALLOWED_DIRS`).

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **File System:** Heavily reliant on the local file system for reading Python source files and writing the `symbol_index.json` and ChromaDB (`vstore/`) directory.
-   **Python `ast` Module:** Directly coupled to Python's Abstract Syntax Tree structure for parsing code. Significant changes to Python's AST in future versions could potentially impact the script, though core nodes like `FunctionDef` and `ClassDef` are stable.
-   **OpenAI API:** Depends on the OpenAI API (and a valid API key) for generating symbol embeddings. Functionality is gracefully degraded (embedding step skipped) if the key is not provided ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:92-94`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:92-94)).
-   **ChromaDB Library:** Depends on the `chromadb` client library API for all vector store operations.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   No explicit unit tests (e.g., a corresponding `tests/test_build_symbol_index.py`) are apparent from the script itself or the provided file listing.
-   **Gaps:**
    -   Testing `extract_symbols` with various valid and invalid Python code structures (e.g., files with syntax errors, different docstring styles, nested functions/classes) would be beneficial.
    -   Mock-based testing for the `main` function's interactions with the file system, `argparse`, and especially the `chromadb` client and OpenAI API would improve robustness and allow testing of the embedding pipeline without actual API calls.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Setup & Configuration:**
    -   Imports necessary modules.
    -   Defines constants like `PY_EXT` (regex for `.py` files) and `ALLOWED_DIRS` (set of directories to scan).
2.  **Argument Parsing ([`main()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:71)):**
    -   Uses `argparse` to define and parse command-line arguments: `--repo-path`, `--db-path`, `--openai-key`, `--batch`.
3.  **File Discovery ([`main()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:71)):**
    -   Resolves the absolute path to the repository.
    -   Recursively searches for `*.py` files (`repo.rglob("*.py")`).
    -   Filters files: must match `PY_EXT`, not be in hidden directories (name starting with `.`), and must be within one of the `ALLOWED_DIRS`.
4.  **Symbol Extraction ([`main()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:71) calls [`extract_symbols()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:29)):**
    -   Iterates through the filtered list of Python files (using `tqdm` for a progress bar).
    -   For each file, [`extract_symbols()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:29) is invoked:
        -   Reads the file content.
        -   Parses the source code into an AST via `ast.parse()`. If a `SyntaxError` occurs, it returns an empty list for that file.
        -   Traverses the AST using `ast.walk()`.
        -   For each `ast.FunctionDef`, `ast.AsyncFunctionDef`, or `ast.ClassDef` node, it extracts:
            -   `name`: Symbol name.
            -   `kind`: Type of symbol (e.g., "FunctionDef").
            -   `path`: Relative file path from the current working directory.
            -   `lineno`: Line number where the symbol is defined.
            -   `summary`: A shortened version of the docstring (or "No docstring.").
        -   Appends a dictionary of these details to a list.
    -   Collects all symbols from all processed files into `all_symbols`.
5.  **JSON Index Output ([`main()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:71)):**
    -   Serializes the `all_symbols` list to a JSON string with indentation.
    -   Writes this string to [`symbol_index.json`](symbol_index.json) ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:88`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:88)).
6.  **Vector DB Indexing (Optional, in [`main()`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:71)):**
    -   Checks if an OpenAI API key was provided. If not, this step is skipped.
    -   Initializes a `chromadb.Client()`.
    -   **Force Refresh:** Deletes the "pulse-code-index" collection if it exists ([`scripts/build_symbol_index.py:103`](scripts/build_symbol_index.py:103)).
    -   Creates (or re-creates) the "pulse-code-index" collection, configuring it with `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction` using the provided API key.
    -   Processes `all_symbols` in batches (size defined by `--batch` argument):
        -   For each batch, prepares:
            -   `texts`: A list of strings representing each symbol for embedding (e.g., "ClassDef MyClassName — Summary of class.").
            -   `ids`: A list of unique IDs for each symbol (e.g., "file/path.py:line_number").
            -   `metadata`: The list of original symbol dictionaries.
        -   Adds these documents, metadatas, and IDs to the Chroma collection via `collection.add()`.
7.  **Output:** Prints status messages to `stdout` indicating progress and completion.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Functions:** `extract_symbols`, `main` (snake_case, adhering to PEP 8).
-   **Variables:** Generally clear and descriptive (e.g., `repo`, `files`, `all_symbols`, `chroma_client`, `collection`). Some short variables like `p` for `ArgumentParser` and `summ` for summary are used locally and are understandable in context.
-   **Constants:** `PY_EXT`, `ALLOWED_DIRS` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, PEP 8 compliant).
