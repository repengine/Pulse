# Module Analysis: `scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of this module is to verify that all required and optional Python package dependencies necessary for running the retrodiction benchmarking scripts are installed in the current Python environment. It checks for both standard library components, external libraries, and internal project modules. The script informs the user about the availability status of each package and will exit with an error if any *required* dependencies are missing, preventing the main benchmark script from running in an incomplete environment.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be **complete and fully operational** for its defined purpose.
- It clearly defines lists of required and optional packages.
- It systematically attempts to import each package.
- It provides clear, user-friendly feedback on the status of each package (available, missing-required, missing-optional).
- It correctly exits if critical dependencies are not met.
- There are no obvious placeholders, `TODO` comments, or unfinished sections within the script.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **No significant gaps identified** for its specific role as a dependency checker. The script is focused and achieves its goal.
- **No signs that the module was intended to be more extensive.** Its scope is well-defined.
- **No implied but missing follow-up features *within this script*.** Its purpose is to support other scripts (e.g., `benchmark_retrodiction.py`, as mentioned in its output).
- **No indications of deviated or stopped development.**

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from other Project Modules:
The script checks for the availability of the following internal project modules:
- [`recursive_training.parallel_trainer`](recursive_training/parallel_trainer.py)
- `recursive_training.data.data_store` (This path suggests a module `data_store.py` within a package `recursive_training.data`)
- [`recursive_training.metrics.metrics_store`](recursive_training/metrics/metrics_store.py)
- [`recursive_training.advanced_metrics.retrodiction_curriculum`](recursive_training/advanced_metrics/retrodiction_curriculum.py)
- [`core.optimized_trust_tracker`](core/optimized_trust_tracker.py) (Assuming path based on typical project structure)
- [`causal_model.optimized_discovery`](causal_model/optimized_discovery.py) (Assuming path based on typical project structure)

### External Library Dependencies:
The script itself uses and also checks for:
- **Used by script:**
    - [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html): Standard library, used to dynamically import modules.
    - [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html): Standard library, used to exit the script.
- **Checked as required:**
    - `cProfile`: Standard library (for profiling).
    - `pstats`: Standard library (for profiling).
    - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
    - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- **Checked as optional:**
    - `psutil`: For system information collection.

### Interaction with other modules via shared data:
- This script does not directly interact with other modules via shared data files, databases, or message queues. Its primary interaction is checking the importability of other Python modules.

### Input/Output Files:
- **Input:** None.
- **Output:** Prints status messages to the standard output (console). Does not create or modify files.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

This module is designed as a standalone script and does not define functions or classes intended for import and use by other modules.
It is executed directly from the command line:
```bash
python scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py
```
The core logic uses [`importlib.import_module(package_name)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module) within a try-except block to check if a module can be imported.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Package Lists:**
    - The `required_packages` list ([`scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:8`](scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:8)) and `optional_packages` list ([`scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:21`](scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:21)) are hardcoded. This is appropriate and necessary for this type of dependency-checking script, as these are the specific dependencies it needs to verify.
- **Script Name in Output:**
    - The name of the main benchmark script, `benchmark_retrodiction.py`, is hardcoded in informational print statements ([`scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:54`](scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:54), [`scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:57`](scripts/benchmarking/check_benchmark_deps.py:57)). This is acceptable for user guidance.
- No hardcoded paths, secrets, or sensitive magic numbers/strings were identified beyond the package names themselves.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **High Coupling to Benchmark Dependencies:** The script is tightly coupled to the specific set of dependencies required by the retrodiction benchmarking process. Any change in the benchmark's dependencies (addition, removal, or renaming of modules/packages) will necessitate an update to the `required_packages` or `optional_packages` lists in this script.
- **Environment Dependency:** Relies on the Python environment's `PYTHONPATH` being correctly configured so that both external libraries and internal project modules (like `recursive_training`, `core`) can be found by [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html).

## 8. Existing Tests

- **No dedicated automated tests** (e.g., a `tests/scripts/benchmarking/test_check_benchmark_deps.py`) were immediately apparent from the provided file list.
- **Manual execution serves as a basic test.**
- **Potential for Automated Tests:** Tests could be written to:
    - Mock [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module) to simulate various scenarios (all packages present, specific required packages missing, specific optional packages missing).
    - Assert the script's standard output messages for each scenario.
    - Assert the script's exit code via [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit) (e.g., `1` if required are missing, `0` otherwise, though currently it only explicitly exits with `1`).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The script follows a straightforward procedural flow:
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Define two lists: `required_packages` and `optional_packages`. Each list contains tuples of `(package_name_str, description_str)`.
    *   Initialize empty lists: `missing_required` and `missing_optional`.
2.  **Check Required Packages:**
    *   Print a status message "Checking required packages...".
    *   Iterate through each `(package, description)` in `required_packages`.
    *   Attempt to import `package` using [`importlib.import_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module).
    *   If successful, print an "✅ Available" message.
    *   If [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError) occurs, print an "❌ Missing" message including the description, and append `package` to `missing_required`.
3.  **Check Optional Packages:**
    *   Print a status message "\nChecking optional packages...".
    *   Iterate through each `(package, description)` in `optional_packages`.
    *   Attempt to import `package`.
    *   If successful, print an "✅ Available" message.
    *   If [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError) occurs, print a "⚠️ Missing" message including the description, and append `package` to `missing_optional`.
4.  **Report Results and Exit:**
    *   If `missing_required` is not empty:
        *   Print an error message indicating that required packages are missing.
        *   Print the list of `missing_required` packages.
        *   Exit the script with status code `1` using [`sys.exit(1)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit).
    *   Else if `missing_optional` is not empty:
        *   Print a warning message that optional packages are missing.
        *   Print the list of `missing_optional` packages.
        *   Inform the user that the benchmark will run with reduced functionality and provide the command to run it.
    *   Else (all packages are available):
        *   Print a success message.
        *   Provide the command to run the benchmark.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Variables:** Names like `required_packages`, `optional_packages`, `missing_required`, `missing_optional`, `package`, `description` are clear and follow PEP 8 (snake_case for functions and variables).
- **Module Name:** `check_benchmark_deps.py` is descriptive of its function.
- **Print Messages:** User-facing messages are clear and use emojis (✅, ❌, ⚠️) for quick visual indication of status.
- **Consistency:** Naming is consistent throughout the module.
- No significant deviations from PEP 8 or potential AI assumption errors in naming were observed.
