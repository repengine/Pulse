# Analysis of `dev_tools/epistemic_mirror_review.py`

**Module Path:** `dev_tools/epistemic_mirror_review.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose
The primary role of this module is to serve as a command-line utility for summarizing and reviewing data from two specific JSONL files: a "foreign causal archive" (likely containing causal relationships identified by an external system, possibly a GPT model) and a "GPT forecast divergence log" (likely logging discrepancies or issues in forecasts generated by a GPT model). The summaries can be printed to the console or exported to a Markdown file, intended to aid operator review and potentially inform "curriculum learning" for the AI/ML system.

## Operational Status/Completeness
The module appears functionally complete for its defined scope. It successfully implements:
- Command-line argument parsing for different operations.
- Reading and parsing JSONL files.
- Data aggregation using `collections.Counter` and `collections.defaultdict`.
- Formatted output to the console.
- Exporting summaries to a Markdown file.
- Basic error handling for `FileNotFoundError` when input files are missing.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
- **No Obvious Placeholders:** The code does not contain explicit "TODO", "FIXME", or similar markers indicating unfinished work.
- **Limited Analysis Depth:** The current summarization is based on frequency counts. Potential extensions could include more sophisticated analyses like trend identification, correlation between fingerprints and divergences, or detailed diffing against an internal knowledge base.
- **"Curriculum Learning" Support:** The docstring mentions "curriculum learning", but the script itself only provides data *for* this purpose. Actual integration with a curriculum learning mechanism is not part of this module.
- **Input Path Flexibility for Export:** While summarization functions accept custom paths, the `export_md_summary` function uses hardcoded global constants for input files. This could be enhanced by allowing these paths to be specified via CLI arguments for the export functionality as well.

## Connections & Dependencies
- **Direct Project Module Imports:** None.
- **External Library Dependencies:**
    - `argparse`, `json`, `collections.Counter`, `collections.defaultdict` (standard Python libraries).
- **Interaction with Other Modules (Implicit):**
    - Relies on the existence and format of files generated by other parts of the system, specifically `GPT/foreign_causal_archive.jsonl` and `GPT/gpt_forecast_divergence_log.jsonl`.
- **Input/Output Files:**
    - **Inputs:** `GPT/foreign_causal_archive.jsonl` and `GPT/gpt_forecast_divergence_log.jsonl` (JSONL format expected).
    - **Outputs:** Console output summarizing counts, and an optional Markdown file containing formatted summaries.

## Function and Class Example Usages
- **Python Functions:**
    - `summarize_foreign_fingerprints(path="path/to/archive.jsonl")`
    - `summarize_divergence_log(path="path/to/log.jsonl")`
    - `export_md_summary(output_md="summary_report.md")`
- **Command-Line Interface:**
    - `python dev_tools/epistemic_mirror_review.py --summarize-foreign-fingerprints`
    - `python dev_tools/epistemic_mirror_review.py --summarize-divergence-log`
    - `python dev_tools/epistemic_mirror_review.py --export-md review_output.md`

## Hardcoding Issues
- Default paths for `FOREIGN_ARCHIVE` and `DIVERGENCE_LOG` are global constants; `export_md_summary` uses these exclusively.
- Expected keys within JSON objects are implicitly hardcoded in parsing logic.

## Coupling Points
- Tightly coupled to the specific schema of `GPT/foreign_causal_archive.jsonl` and `GPT/gpt_forecast_divergence_log.jsonl`.

## Existing Tests
- No dedicated test file appears to exist.

## Module Architecture and Flow
1.  Defines global constants for default input file paths.
2.  `summarize_foreign_fingerprints(path)`: Reads JSONL, counts occurrences of (variable, consequence) pairs, prints summary.
3.  `summarize_divergence_log(path)`: Reads JSONL, counts "divergence_type", prints summary.
4.  `export_md_summary(output_md)`: Reads default input files, formats summaries into Markdown, writes to output file.
5.  `main()`: Parses CLI arguments and calls respective functions.

## Naming Conventions
- Follows Python conventions (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants, snake_case for functions/variables). Names are clear.
