# Module Analysis: `forecast_engine/forecast_compressor.py`

## 1. Purpose

The [`forecast_engine/forecast_compressor.py`](forecast_engine/forecast_compressor.py:1) module provides a utility function, [`compress_mc_samples()`](forecast_engine/forecast_compressor.py:4), to summarize or "compress" a list of Monte Carlo (MC) forecast samples. Instead of dealing with numerous individual sample paths, this function distills them into a more manageable representation: the mean of the samples and a prediction interval (lower and upper percentile bounds) for each forecasted field.

## 2. Key Functionalities

The primary functionality is encapsulated in the [`compress_mc_samples(mc_samples: List[Dict[str, np.ndarray]], alpha: float = 0.9) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, np.ndarray]]`](forecast_engine/forecast_compressor.py:4) function:

*   **Input:**
    *   `mc_samples`: A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents one Monte Carlo sample (or path). Within each dictionary, keys are field names (strings), and values are 1D NumPy arrays representing the forecasted values for that field over time. It's assumed that for a given field, all arrays across different samples have the same length (number of time steps).
    *   `alpha`: A float between 0 and 1 (defaulting to 0.9) representing the desired coverage probability for the prediction interval. For example, `alpha = 0.9` corresponds to a 90% prediction interval.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  It first checks if the `mc_samples` list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if it is.
    2.  Calculates the lower and upper percentile values based on `alpha`. For `alpha = 0.9`, this would be the 5th percentile (`(1 - 0.9) / 2 * 100`) and the 95th percentile (`(1 + 0.9) / 2 * 100`).
    3.  Iterates through each field present in the first sample (assuming all samples have the same fields).
    4.  For each `field`:
        *   It stacks the corresponding 1D arrays from all samples in `mc_samples` into a 2D NumPy array. If there are `N` samples and `T` time steps, this array will have the shape `(N, T)`.
        *   Calculates the mean across the samples (axis 0) to get a 1D array of shape `(T,)`.
        *   Calculates the lower percentile across the samples (axis 0) to get a 1D array of shape `(T,)`.
        *   Calculates the upper percentile across the samples (axis 0) to get a 1D array of shape `(T,)`.
*   **Output:**
    *   Returns a dictionary where keys are the original field names.
    *   Each value is another dictionary containing three keys:
        *   `'mean'`: The 1D NumPy array of mean values over time.
        *   `'lower'`: The 1D NumPy array of lower prediction interval bounds over time.
        *   `'upper'`: The 1D NumPy array of upper prediction interval bounds over time.

## 3. Role within `forecast_engine/`

This module serves as a data reduction and summarization tool within the `forecast_engine/`. When forecasting methods produce a large number of Monte Carlo samples (e.g., from probabilistic models or simulations with uncertainty), this compressor provides a way to represent the forecast distribution concisely. This compressed format (mean and prediction interval) is often more practical for visualization, reporting, and decision-making than handling raw MC samples.

## 4. Dependencies

### Internal Pulse Modules:

*   None explicitly imported or used.

### External Libraries:

*   `numpy` (as `np`): Used extensively for numerical operations, particularly for creating and manipulating arrays (`np.ndarray`), stacking arrays (`np.stack`), and calculating mean (`np.mean`) and percentiles (`np.percentile`).
*   `typing`: Standard Python library providing type hints (`List`, `Dict`).

## 5. Adherence to SPARC Principles

*   **Simplicity:** The function has a single, clear purpose and its implementation, while using NumPy, follows a logical flow of stacking data and then applying aggregation functions.
*   **Iterate:** The function iterates through the fields of the forecast samples to process each one.
*   **Focus:** The module is highly focused on the specific task of compressing Monte Carlo samples into mean and prediction intervals.
*   **Quality:**
    *   The code is well-documented with a clear docstring explaining parameters, return values, and the purpose of the function.
    *   Type hinting is used effectively for function arguments and return types, improving readability and maintainability.
    *   Includes a basic validation check to ensure `mc_samples` is not empty.
    *   The use of NumPy is appropriate and efficient for the numerical computations involved.
*   **Collaboration:** This module provides a utility that can be used by various other components within the forecast engine that generate or consume Monte Carlo samples, facilitating a common way to summarize such data.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness:** The module and its single function [`compress_mc_samples()`](forecast_engine/forecast_compressor.py:4) are complete for their stated purpose of deriving mean and prediction intervals from MC samples.
*   **Clarity:** The code is very clear and easy to understand. The logic is straightforward, and variable names are descriptive. The docstring is comprehensive.
*   **Quality:** The quality of the module is high. It's a concise, well-written utility that uses an appropriate library (NumPy) efficiently. The inclusion of type hints and a good docstring contributes significantly to its quality. The error handling for empty input is a good practice.

## 7. Recommendations

*   Consider adding a check to ensure that all dictionaries in `mc_samples` contain the same set of fields, or define behavior if they don't (e.g., process only common fields, raise an error). Currently, it assumes all samples have the fields present in `mc_samples[0]`.
*   It might be beneficial to also check if `mc_samples[field]` arrays are indeed 1D and have consistent lengths across samples for a given field, raising a `ValueError` if inconsistencies are found, to prevent unexpected `np.stack` behavior or errors.
*   For robustness, ensure `alpha` is strictly between 0 and 1 (e.g., `0 < alpha < 1`). Currently, `alpha = 0` or `alpha = 1` would lead to `lower_pct = 50, upper_pct = 50` or `lower_pct = 0, upper_pct = 100` respectively, which might be valid but worth noting or explicitly handling if they represent edge cases not intended for typical prediction intervals.
