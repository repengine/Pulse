# Module Analysis: `api_key_report.py`

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-14
**Module Path:** [`api_key_report.py`](../../../api_key_report.py)

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`api_key_report.py`](../../../api_key_report.py:1) module is to test and report on the accessibility and validity of API keys for external financial data services: FRED, Finnhub, and NASDAQ. It checks for the presence of these keys as environment variables using two common naming conventions (e.g., `FRED_API_KEY` and `FRED_KEY`) and attempts a basic API call to each service to verify connectivity.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its defined purpose. It successfully checks for environment variables and attempts connections to the specified APIs. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments indicating unfinished core functionality. The NASDAQ API test function includes logic to try multiple free-tier endpoints and specifically handles `410 Gone` errors, suggesting some level of maturity and adaptation to API changes.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Extensibility for New APIs:** While functional for the current set of APIs (FRED, Finnhub, NASDAQ), adding new APIs would require modifying the main `apis` list and potentially adding new `test_<api_name>_api` functions. A more plugin-based or configurable approach could improve extensibility.
- **Configuration of Key Names:** The alternative key names (e.g., `FRED_KEY` vs. `FRED_API_KEY`) are hardcoded. This could be made configurable if more variations are expected.
- **Detailed Error Reporting:** While it reports success/failure and status codes, it could be enhanced to capture and log more detailed error responses from the APIs, which might be useful for debugging.
- **Output Format:** The current output is a simple console print. For integration into a larger system, a structured output (JSON, XML, or a report file) might be more useful.

## Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from Other Project Modules
- Based on the content of [`api_key_report.py`](../../../api_key_report.py:1) and the provided [`docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md`](../../../docs/sprint0_analysis_report.md), this module does **not** appear to have direct imports from other custom project modules. It is a standalone utility script.

### External Library Dependencies
- [`os`](../../../api_key_report.py:9): Used for accessing environment variables ([`os.environ.get()`](../../../api_key_report.py:25)).
- [`requests`](../../../api_key_report.py:10): Used for making HTTP GET requests to the external APIs.
- [`json`](../../../api_key_report.py:11): Implicitly used by `requests` for handling JSON responses, and potentially for parsing API responses if they were more complex (though not directly used for parsing in the current script).
- [`datetime`](../../../api_key_report.py:12): Used for timestamping the report generation ([`datetime.now()`](../../../api_key_report.py:196)).
- [`sys`](../../../api_key_report.py:13): Used for exiting the script with a status code ([`sys.exit()`](../../../api_key_report.py:202)).

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data
- **Environment Variables:** The primary interaction is reading API keys from environment variables, which could be set by other parts of the system or deployment scripts.
- **No direct file/database/message queue interaction** with other project modules is apparent.

### Input/Output Files
- **Input:** Reads API keys from environment variables.
- **Output:**
    - Prints a formatted report to the console.
    - Does not generate any persistent log files or data files.

## Function and Class Example Usages

The module is script-based and primarily uses functions:

- **[`mask_key(key)`](../../../api_key_report.py:15):**
    - Purpose: Masks parts of an API key string for secure display.
    - Usage: `masked_api_key = mask_key("your_actual_api_key")`
- **[`check_environment_variable(name)`](../../../api_key_report.py:23):**
    - Purpose: Checks if a given environment variable exists and returns its details.
    - Usage: `fred_key_info = check_environment_variable("FRED_API_KEY")`
- **[`test_fred_api(api_key)`](../../../api_key_report.py:33):**
    - Purpose: Tests connectivity to the FRED API using the provided key.
    - Usage: `fred_test_result = test_fred_api(os.environ.get("FRED_API_KEY"))`
- **[`test_finnhub_api(api_key)`](../../../api_key_report.py:52):**
    - Purpose: Tests connectivity to the Finnhub API.
    - Usage: `finnhub_test_result = test_finnhub_api(os.environ.get("FINNHUB_API_KEY"))`
- **[`test_nasdaq_api(api_key)`](../../../api_key_report.py:71):**
    - Purpose: Tests connectivity to the NASDAQ Data Link API using a list of free-tier endpoints.
    - Usage: `nasdaq_test_result = test_nasdaq_api(os.environ.get("NASDAQ_API_KEY"))`
- **[`format_result(api_name, key_name, key_value, test_result=None)`](../../../api_key_report.py:110):**
    - Purpose: Formats the test result for a specific API key for console display.
    - Usage: `print(format_result("FRED", "FRED_API_KEY", key_val, fred_test_result))`
- **[`main()`](../../../api_key_report.py:123):**
    - Purpose: Orchestrates the entire testing process: defines APIs, iterates through them, calls test functions, and prints a summary.
    - Usage: Executed when the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__": sys.exit(main())`).

## Hardcoding Issues

- **API Endpoint URLs:** The base URLs and specific test endpoints for FRED ([`https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series?series_id=GDP...`](../../../api_key_report.py:35)), Finnhub ([`https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=AAPL...`](../../../api_key_report.py:54)), and NASDAQ ([`https://data.nasdaq.com/api/v3/datasets/...`](../../../api_key_report.py:75)) are hardcoded.
- **API Key Environment Variable Names:** The list of primary and alternative environment variable names for each API (e.g., `['FRED_API_KEY', 'FRED_KEY']`) is hardcoded in the `apis` list within the [`main()`](../../../api_key_report.py:129) function.
- **NASDAQ Test Endpoints:** The specific datasets/endpoints tried for NASDAQ API testing (e.g., `LBMA/GOLD`, `FRED/GDP`) are hardcoded within the [`test_nasdaq_api()`](../../../api_key_report.py:74) function.
- **Timeout Value:** The `timeout=10` for `requests.get()` calls is hardcoded in each API test function.
- **Masking Logic:** The character counts for masking keys (e.g., show first 4, last 4 for keys longer than 8 chars) are hardcoded in [`mask_key()`](../../../api_key_report.py:19).
- **Report Strings:** Various strings for report formatting and messages (e.g., "API KEY TESTING REPORT", "Connection test:", "All endpoints failed") are hardcoded.

No hardcoded secrets (like actual API keys) were found in the module; it correctly relies on environment variables.

## Coupling Points

- **Environment:** Tightly coupled to the system's environment variables for API key retrieval.
- **External APIs:** Directly coupled to the specific URLs and expected behaviors of the FRED, Finnhub, and NASDAQ APIs. Changes in these external APIs (e.g., endpoint URLs, authentication methods, response codes) could break the script.
- **`requests` library:** Relies on the `requests` library for HTTP communication.

The module is largely self-contained and does not exhibit significant coupling with other internal project modules.

## Existing Tests

- A dedicated test file, expected at [`tests/test_api_key_report.py`](../../../tests/test_api_key_report.py), was **not found**.
- The module itself acts as a test script, but it does not have automated unit tests or integration tests to verify its own logic (e.g., the correctness of the key masking, the environment variable checking, or the API test functions under various conditions like network errors or different API responses).

## Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Initialization:** The [`main()`](../../../api_key_report.py:123) function is the entry point.
2.  **API Definition:** A list of dictionaries (`apis`) defines the services to test, their associated environment variable key names, and the respective test function.
3.  **Iteration:** The script iterates through each defined API.
    *   For each API, it iterates through the list of possible environment variable names.
    *   It calls [`check_environment_variable()`](../../../api_key_report.py:23) (indirectly, via [`os.environ.get()`](../../../api_key_report.py:150)) to retrieve the key's value.
    *   If a key is found:
        *   The corresponding test function (e.g., [`test_fred_api()`](../../../api_key_report.py:33)) is called with the key.
        *   These test functions use the `requests` library to make an API call.
        *   They return a dictionary indicating success, status code, and a message.
    *   The result is formatted using [`format_result()`](../../../api_key_report.py:110) (which uses [`mask_key()`](../../../api_key_report.py:15)) and printed to the console.
4.  **Summary:** After testing all APIs, a summary of which keys were found and which connections were successful is printed.
5.  **Overall Status & Notes:** An overall status message is printed, along with specific notes if certain conditions (like NASDAQ failure) are met.
6.  **Timestamp & Exit:** The completion time is printed, and the script exits with status `0` if all keys were found, or `1` otherwise.

The architecture is a simple procedural script.

## Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** Generally follow PEP 8 (e.g., `mask_key`, `check_environment_variable`, `test_fred_api`).
- **Variables:** Generally follow PEP 8 (e.g., `api_name`, `key_value`, `test_result`).
- **Constants (Environment Variable Names):** Stored as strings in a list, following typical uppercase convention for environment variables (e.g., `FRED_API_KEY`).
- **Clarity:** Names are generally clear and descriptive of their purpose.
- No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations from PEP 8 were noted.

## SPARC Compliance Summary

- **Specification:** The module has a clear, albeit simple, specification: test API keys. It fulfills this specification.
- **Testability:** Lacks dedicated unit/integration tests for its own logic, which is a significant gap. The script itself is a test, but its internal components are not independently tested.
- **Maintainability:**
    - Good: Code is relatively straightforward and well-commented. Functions are small and focused.
    - Fair: Hardcoding of URLs, key names, and report strings reduces maintainability if these need to change frequently.
- **No Hardcoding (Secrets):** Compliant. API keys are correctly sourced from environment variables.
- **No Hardcoding (Config/Paths):** Partially compliant. While secrets are not hardcoded, API URLs, environment variable patterns, and test dataset names are.
- **Modularity:** The module is self-contained. Functions for testing each API are separate.
- **Security:** Good practice of masking API keys before display.
- **Scalability/Extensibility:** Limited. Adding new APIs or changing key name patterns requires code modification rather than configuration.

Overall, the module is a functional utility for its specific purpose. Key areas for SPARC improvement would be enhancing testability with a dedicated test suite and reducing hardcoding of API-specific details to improve maintainability and extensibility.
