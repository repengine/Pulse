# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py) module is to track and log symbolic overlay states across different turns within each simulation. These logs are intended for downstream symbolic analysis, providing a record of how symbolic states evolve during a simulation run.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be complete and operational for its defined purpose. The docstring indicates its status as "✅ Built + Enhanced" ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:19`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:19)). The code is concise and directly addresses the task of logging symbolic states. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments within the provided code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Extensiveness:** The module is highly specific and seems complete for its narrow function of logging. It does not show signs of being intended for broader responsibilities.
*   **Logical Next Steps:** The clear next step implied by this module is the development or integration of other modules that would consume and analyze the generated `jsonl` log files. The module itself is a data provider.
*   **Deviation/Stoppage:** There are no indications that development started on a more extensive path and then deviated or stopped short. Its simplicity aligns with its focused purpose.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Imports:**
    *   [`utils.log_utils.get_logger`](utils/log_utils.py) for application-level logging.
    *   [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py) for accessing configured directory paths, specifically for `SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH` and `WORLDSTATE_LOG_DIR`.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `json`: For serializing log entries.
    *   `os`: For directory creation ([`os.makedirs()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:35), [`os.path.dirname()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:35)).
    *   `datetime` (from `datetime`): For timestamping log entries.
    *   `typing.Dict`, `typing.Optional`: For type hinting.
*   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    *   The module's primary output and interaction point is a log file, by default [`logs/symbolic_memory_log.jsonl`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:32) or a path derived from `PATHS["WORLDSTATE_LOG_DIR"]`. This `.jsonl` file is intended for consumption by other (downstream) analysis modules.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Output:** Writes to a JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) file containing symbolic state entries. Example path: `logs/symbolic_memory_log.jsonl`.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains a single primary function, [`record_symbolic_state()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:37). An example of its usage is provided within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:65-70`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:65-70)):

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    record_symbolic_state(
        turn=1,
        overlays={"hope": 0.51, "despair": 0.28, "rage": 0.12, "fatigue": 0.09},
        sim_id="sim_0425A"
    )
```
This demonstrates how to log the symbolic overlays for a given turn in a specific simulation.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Log Path:** The variable [`SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:32) has a hardcoded default fallback value of `"logs/symbolic_memory_log.jsonl"`. This is used if `SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH` is not found in the `PATHS` dictionary.
*   **Metadata Version:** The log entry metadata includes a hardcoded version string: `"version": "v0.21.1"` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:54`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:54)). This could become stale if not updated with module changes.
*   **Metadata Source:** The log entry metadata includes a hardcoded source file path: `"source": "main/symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py"` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:55`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:55)).

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Configuration (`core.path_registry`):** The module is coupled to the [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py) dictionary for determining the log file path. Changes to the keys (`"SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH"`, `"WORLDSTATE_LOG_DIR"`) or structure of `PATHS` could affect this module.
*   **Logging Utility (`utils.log_utils`):** Depends on [`get_logger()`](utils/log_utils.py) from [`utils.log_utils`](utils/log_utils.py) for its internal logging.
*   **Log File Format:** The structure of the JSON objects written to the `.jsonl` file creates a coupling point with any downstream modules that consume these logs. Changes to the log entry schema would require updates in consumers.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   **Dedicated Test File:** Based on the provided file listing, there does not appear to be a specific test file such as `tests/symbolic_system/test_symbolic_memory.py`.
*   **Inline Example/Smoke Test:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:65-70`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:65-70)) serves as a basic functional example and a minimal smoke test.
*   **Coverage:** Without dedicated tests, formal test coverage is likely zero or minimal. The module's simplicity might make extensive testing seem less critical, but unit tests for input validation and file I/O would be beneficial.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Structure:** The module consists of:
    *   A global logger instance.
    *   A constant for the default symbolic log path ([`SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:32)).
    *   A helper function [`ensure_log_dir()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:34) to create the log directory if it doesn't exist.
    *   The main public function [`record_symbolic_state()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:37) responsible for logging.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   [`record_symbolic_state()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:37): Core logic for validating inputs, constructing the log entry, and writing to the file.
*   **Primary Data/Control Flow:**
    1.  External code calls [`record_symbolic_state()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:37) with `turn`, `overlays` (a dictionary of symbolic states), and an optional `sim_id` and `log_path`.
    2.  Input parameters (`turn`, `overlays`) are validated for correct type and value constraints.
    3.  The target log path is determined (either from `log_path` argument, `PATHS["WORLDSTATE_LOG_DIR"]`, or the default `SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH`).
    4.  [`ensure_log_dir()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py:34) is called to create the directory for the log file.
    5.  A dictionary (`entry`) is constructed containing:
        *   Current UTC timestamp.
        *   Simulation ID.
        *   Turn number.
        *   The provided symbolic overlays.
        *   Hardcoded metadata (version and source file).
    6.  The `entry` dictionary is serialized to a JSON string.
    7.  The JSON string is appended as a new line to the specified log file.
    8.  If any `Exception` occurs during file writing, an error is logged using the module's logger.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** `record_symbolic_state`, `ensure_log_dir` – follow PEP 8 `snake_case`.
*   **Variables:** `turn`, `overlays`, `sim_id`, `log_path`, `entry`, `path` – follow PEP 8 `snake_case`.
*   **Constants:** `SYMBOLIC_LOG_PATH`, `PATHS` – follow PEP 8 `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
*   **Overall:** Naming conventions are consistent and adhere to Python community standards (PEP 8).
*   **AI Assumption Errors:** The code's naming seems appropriate and human-like. The metadata in the module docstring ("Pulse Version", "Author: Pulse AI Engine") suggests AI involvement in generating the file's boilerplate, but the code's naming itself is standard.
