# Module Analysis: `dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The `dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py` module is a utility script designed to maintain project hygiene by identifying and managing duplicate or misplaced Python files within the Pulse project. It aims to enforce a canonical directory structure for specific, known files.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   Scans the project directory (starting from the current directory by default) for all `.py` files, excluding `__init__.py` files ([`find_files()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:49)).
*   Identifies duplicate files based on filename.
*   For files listed in a predefined `CANONICAL_PATHS` dictionary ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33)), it checks if they are in their designated canonical directory.
*   If duplicates are found for a canonical file, it prioritizes the most recently modified version.
*   Moves older versions or misplaced versions of canonical files to a specified quarantine directory (defaulting to `./quarantine/`).
*   If the most recent version of a canonical file is not in its correct location, it copies this newest version to the canonical path and then moves the original (now considered misplaced) to quarantine.
*   Provides a `--dry-run` option to preview actions without actually moving or copying files.
*   Allows specification of a custom quarantine directory via the `--quarantine` argument.
*   Offers a `--verbose` option for more detailed output during its run.
*   Prints a summary of files checked, duplicates found, and files moved/quarantined.
*   Handles file operation errors gracefully by logging warnings.

## 3. Role within `dev_tools/`

This module acts as a project maintenance and organization tool within the `dev_tools/` directory. Its role is to help developers keep the project structure clean and consistent, especially for critical or commonly used modules whose locations are expected to be standardized. By quarantining duplicates, it prevents confusion and potential issues arising from using outdated or misplaced code.

## 4. Dependencies

### Internal Pulse Modules:
*   [`utils.log_utils.get_logger`](utils/log_utils.py) (imported as `get_logger` and used to initialize `logger`)
*   [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py:29) (used to get the default quarantine directory path)

### External Libraries:
*   `os` (Python standard library): Used for file system operations like walking directories, path manipulation, getting file modification times, and creating directories.
*   `shutil` (Python standard library): Used for file operations like moving (`shutil.move`) and copying (`shutil.copy2`).
*   `collections.defaultdict` (Python standard library): Used in [`find_files()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:49) to group file paths by filename.
*   `argparse` (Python standard library): Used for parsing command-line arguments.
*   `typing.Dict`, `typing.List` (Python standard library): Used for type hinting.

## 5. SPARC Principles Adherence Assessment

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:** Clearly stated in the module docstring ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:1-21`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:1)). The tool has a focused purpose related to project organization.
*   **Operational Status/Completeness:** The module appears operational for its defined scope. It correctly identifies files, compares modification times, and performs file operations (or simulates them in dry-run mode).
*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   The `CANONICAL_PATHS` dictionary ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33)) is hardcoded and relatively small. For a large project, maintaining this list manually could become cumbersome. A more dynamic way to define or discover canonical paths might be beneficial, or this list needs to be diligently updated.
    *   The script only considers `.py` files. Other types of duplicated or misplaced project files are not handled.
    *   Duplicate detection is solely based on filename. It does not check file content, so two different files with the same name in different locations would be treated as duplicates of each other if that filename is in `CANONICAL_PATHS`.
*   **Connections & Dependencies:** Relies on standard Python libraries and two internal Pulse utilities. Its main "external" dependency is the file system structure it operates on and the `CANONICAL_PATHS` configuration.
*   **Function and Class Example Usages:** The script is executed directly. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:148`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:148)) shows its primary usage. Key functions are [`find_files()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:49), [`move_to_quarantine()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:64), and [`run_cleaner()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:84).
*   **Hardcoding Issues:**
    *   `CANONICAL_PATHS` ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33)) is hardcoded, as mentioned. This is central to the script's logic.
    *   The script implicitly assumes it's run from the project root for `os.walk(".")` ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:56`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:56)) and for constructing `expected_path` ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:103`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:103)). While common, this could be made more robust or explicit.
*   **Coupling Points:**
    *   Tightly coupled to the `CANONICAL_PATHS` dictionary. Changes to the project's desired structure for these specific files require updating this dictionary.
    *   Dependent on the [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py:29) for the default quarantine directory, though this can be overridden by a command-line argument.
*   **Existing Tests:** No tests are included within this module file.
*   **Module Architecture and Flow:**
    1.  Parse command-line arguments ([`parse_args()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:135)).
    2.  Find all `.py` files in the project ([`find_files()`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:49)).
    3.  Iterate through each unique filename found:
        *   Check if the filename is in `CANONICAL_PATHS`. If not, skip.
        *   Sort all found paths for this filename by modification time (newest first).
        *   The newest file is considered the primary candidate.
        *   Determine the `expected_path` based on `CANONICAL_PATHS`.
        *   Iterate through other (older) paths for the same filename: if they are not already the `expected_path`, move them to quarantine ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:107-110`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:107)).
        *   If the newest file itself is not at the `expected_path`:
            *   Copy the newest file to `expected_path`.
            *   Move the original newest file (from its incorrect location) to quarantine ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:113-124`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:113)).
    4.  Print a summary.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Generally follows PEP 8.

## 6. Overall Assessment (Completeness and Quality)

*   **Completeness:** The module is complete for its defined task of cleaning up specified canonical files based on filename and modification date.
*   **Quality:**
    *   **Strengths:** The script provides a useful service for maintaining project organization. The `--dry-run` feature is crucial for a tool that modifies the file system. Error handling for file operations is included. The code is clear and includes docstrings.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   **Scalability of `CANONICAL_PATHS`:** As the project grows, the hardcoded `CANONICAL_PATHS` list ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:33)) might become a maintenance bottleneck. Consider externalizing this configuration or finding a more dynamic way to define these paths if the list becomes very large.
        *   **Content-based Duplication:** The current duplicate detection is filename-based. True duplicates (identical content, different names/locations) are not identified. This is outside its current stated scope but a potential enhancement for a more general "cleaner" tool.
        *   **Definition of "Misplaced":** "Misplaced" is currently defined only for files in `CANONICAL_PATHS`. Other files are not checked for being in an "incorrect" location.
        *   **User Interaction for Ambiguity:** If multiple files have the exact same modification time, the choice of `sorted_paths[0]` ([`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:101`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:101)) is deterministic but arbitrary. For critical files, some form of user confirmation might be desired in highly ambiguous cases, though this would complicate a CLI tool.

## 7. Summary Note for Main Report

The [`dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py`](dev_tools/pulse_dir_cleaner.py:1) module helps organize the project by identifying duplicate or misplaced Python files (based on a predefined list of canonical paths) and moving them to a quarantine directory, keeping the most recently modified version in the correct location. Its reliance on a hardcoded list of canonical paths might be a scalability concern.
