# Analysis of `docs/ai_training_architecture.md`

## 1. Document Purpose

This document describes the architecture of the AI Training Layer for the Pulse project. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how AI models are trained, evaluated, and integrated into the system, with a focus on data flow, core modules, and system-wide considerations like traceability and security.

## 2. Key Topics Covered

The document covers a wide range of topics related to the AI training architecture:

*   **Core Modules:** Details components like Iris Data Ingestion, Preprocessor & Feature Store, Training Orchestration, Model Manager & Registry, Evaluation Engine, and Rule Generator & Pruner.
*   **End-to-End Data Flow:** Describes the sequence of data processing from ingestion to model evaluation and feedback.
*   **Integration Points:** Lists key modules and functions where the AI training layer interacts with other parts of the Pulse system (e.g., [`forecast_engine.ai_forecaster`](../../forecast_engine/ai_forecaster.py:1), [`trust_system.retrodiction_engine`](../../trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:1)).
*   **Training & Evaluation Loop:** Specifies APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ray RLlib), metrics (MAE, symbolic alignment, trust/regret delta), and feedback mechanisms.
*   **Dynamic Rule Generation & Pruning:** Outlines the process for proposing, evaluating, storing, and pruning rules.
*   **Recommended Frameworks & Tools:** Suggests tools like Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, Ray RLlib, MLflow, DVC, Weights & Biases, OpenAI SDK, and Airflow.
*   **Schema Drift Detection and Reconciliation:** Discusses mechanisms for managing schema changes in data streams and causal models, including monitoring and reconciliation processes.
*   **System-Wide Traceability and Audit Logging:** Details how trace IDs and audit logs are generated and used for tracking decision flows.
*   **Error Handling and Resilience Mechanisms:** Describes layered error detection, automated recovery, and human-in-the-loop escalation.
*   **Security and Adversarial Robustness:** Covers input sanitization, prompt injection detection, and security testing.
*   **Technical Integration Mechanisms:** Explains communication patterns (event streams, API contracts, shared memory), component adapters, and integration protocols.
*   **Mermaid Diagrams:** Multiple diagrams visualize the overall architecture, schema drift handling, traceability, error handling, security, and integration mechanisms.
