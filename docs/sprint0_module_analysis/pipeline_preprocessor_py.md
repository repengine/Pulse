# Module Analysis: `pipeline/preprocessor.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`pipeline/preprocessor.py`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:1) module is to provide a `Preprocessor` class responsible for ingesting various raw data sources (forecasts, retrodictions, IRIS data), merging them, performing feature engineering and normalization, and finally saving the processed features to a feature store. It acts as a crucial step in preparing data for model training within a data pipeline.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module is largely a **skeleton implementation** and is **highly incomplete**.

*   The `__init__` method ([`pipeline/preprocessor.py:7`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:7)) initializes paths for raw data and the feature store.
*   The `save_features` method ([`pipeline/preprocessor.py:41`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:41)) has a basic implementation to save a pandas DataFrame to a Parquet file, including directory creation.
*   All other core methods (`load_raw`, `merge_data`, `normalize`, `compute_features`) contain `TODO` comments and `pass` statements, indicating that their primary logic is yet to be implemented.
    *   [`load_raw()`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13)
    *   [`merge_data()`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:20)
    *   [`normalize()`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:27)
    *   [`compute_features()`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:34)

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Data Loading (`load_raw`):** The most significant gap is the lack of implementation for loading data from "PFPA archive, retrodiction memory, and IRIS snapshots" as indicated by the `TODO` in [`pipeline/preprocessor.py:17`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:17). The specifics of these data sources and their formats are not defined within this module.
*   **Data Merging (`merge_data`):** The logic to merge different raw data sources (e.g., live forecasts with retrodiction results) is missing ([`pipeline/preprocessor.py:24`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:24)).
*   **Feature Engineering (`compute_features`):** No feature engineering steps are implemented ([`pipeline/preprocessor.py:38`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:38)). This is a critical part of a preprocessor.
*   **Normalization (`normalize`):** The method for applying scaling or normalization to numeric features is not implemented ([`pipeline/preprocessor.py:31`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:31)).
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** There is no apparent error handling or logging mechanism.
*   **Configuration:** The module could benefit from more sophisticated configuration management, e.g., for data source types, feature engineering steps, or normalization techniques, rather than relying solely on hardcoded logic (once implemented).

The module appears to be an initial stub, with development having stopped before the core functionalities were built. Logical next steps would involve implementing the `TODO` sections, starting with data loading and progressing through the preprocessing pipeline.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
*   None.

### External Library Dependencies:
*   [`pandas`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:1) (for data manipulation)
*   [`json`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:2) (standard library, usage not apparent in current stub)
*   [`typing`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:3) (for type hints: `List`, `Dict`)
*   [`pathlib`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:4) (for path manipulation: `Path`)

### Interaction with Other Modules/Systems:
*   **Input Data Sources:** The module is intended to interact with:
    *   PFPA (Pulse Forecast Performance Archive) - for historical forecast data.
    *   Retrodiction Memory - for results of past retrodictions.
    *   IRIS Snapshots - for observational data.
    The exact mechanism (file system, database, API) is not defined in this module.
*   **Feature Store:** The module writes processed features to a specified path ([`self.feature_store_path`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:9)), currently as a Parquet file. This feature store would then be consumed by model training modules.

### Input/Output Files:
*   **Input:** Reads raw data files from the directory specified by [`raw_data_dir`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:8). The structure and format of these files are not defined.
*   **Output:** Writes processed features to a Parquet file at [`feature_store_path`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:9). Example: `features.parquet`.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

```python
from pipeline.preprocessor import Preprocessor

# Initialize the preprocessor
raw_data_location = "data/raw/"
feature_store_file = "data/processed/features.parquet"
processor = Preprocessor(raw_data_dir=raw_data_location, feature_store_path=feature_store_file)

# --- The following methods are currently stubs ---
# Load raw data
# processor.load_raw() 

# Merge different data sources
# processor.merge_data()

# Compute derived features
# processor.compute_features()

# Normalize features
# processor.normalize()
# --- End stubs ---

# Save the (currently empty) features
# This will create an empty Parquet file if self.features is empty.
output_path = processor.save_features()
print(f"Processed features saved to: {output_path}")

```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **File Format for Feature Store:** The [`save_features`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:41) method currently hardcodes the output format to Parquet ([`self.features.to_parquet(self.feature_store_path)`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:47)). While Parquet is a good choice, this could be made configurable.
*   The paths [`raw_data_dir`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:8) and [`feature_store_path`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:9) are passed during instantiation, which is good practice. No other significant hardcoding issues are apparent in the current stub.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Data Source Coupling:** The module will be tightly coupled to the format, structure, and access methods of the raw data sources (PFPA, retrodiction memory, IRIS) once [`load_raw`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13) is implemented.
*   **Feature Store Coupling:** Coupled to the chosen output format (currently Parquet) and storage location of the feature store.
*   **Downstream Model Training:** The structure and content of the generated `features` DataFrame will directly impact downstream model training modules.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   No test files were found for this module in the `tests/pipeline/` directory or a specific `tests/test_preprocessor.py`.
*   Given the module's incompleteness, comprehensive tests cannot be written yet, but tests for the existing `save_features` functionality (e.g., directory creation, file writing with an empty DataFrame) could be implemented.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The intended architecture is a sequential pipeline within the `Preprocessor` class:

1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    *   Accepts paths for the raw data directory and the output feature store.
    *   Initializes internal `Path` objects for these locations.
    *   Initializes `self.raw_data` as an empty dictionary (presumably to hold DataFrames loaded by name).
    *   Initializes `self.features` as an empty pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Load Raw Data (`load_raw`)** (TODO):
    *   Intended to load data from various sources (PFPA, retrodiction memory, IRIS snapshots).
    *   This data would likely populate `self.raw_data`.
3.  **Merge Data (`merge_data`)** (TODO):
    *   Intended to merge the loaded raw datasets.
    *   The result of the merge would likely update or form `self.features`.
4.  **Compute Features (`compute_features`)** (TODO):
    *   Intended to perform feature engineering based on the merged data in `self.features`.
    *   Derived features would be added to or modify `self.features`.
5.  **Normalize Data (`normalize`)** (TODO):
    *   Intended to apply numerical scaling or normalization techniques to `self.features`.
6.  **Save Features (`save_features`)**:
    *   Ensures the parent directory for the feature store path exists.
    *   Saves the `self.features` DataFrame to the specified `feature_store_path` as a Parquet file.
    *   Returns the string path of the saved feature store file.

The overall flow is to ingest, combine, transform, and then persist data for later use.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** `Preprocessor` is clear and follows PascalCase, appropriate for Python classes.
*   **Method Names:** `__init__`, `load_raw`, `merge_data`, `normalize`, `compute_features`, `save_features` are descriptive, use snake_case, and clearly indicate their intended actions, adhering to PEP 8.
*   **Variable Names:**
    *   Instance variables like `raw_data_dir`, `feature_store_path`, `raw_data`, `features` use snake_case and are descriptive.
    *   Type hints (`List`, `Dict`, `Path`, `str`, `pd.DataFrame`) are used, improving readability.
*   **TODO Comments:** Clearly mark unimplemented sections.

The naming conventions are consistent and align well with Python community standards (PEP 8). No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations were noted.
