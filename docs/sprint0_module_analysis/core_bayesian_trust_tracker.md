# Bayesian Trust Tracker Module Analysis (`core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py`)

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The [`core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:1) module is designed to track and manage the trustworthiness or confidence level of various entities within the Pulse system, such as rules or variables. It employs a Bayesian approach, utilizing Beta distributions to represent trust, where `alpha` parameters correspond to successes and `beta` parameters to failures. This allows for a probabilistic measure of trust that updates with new evidence.

The module provides a singleton instance, [`bayesian_trust_tracker`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:213), for global access and thread-safe operations.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **Trust Updates:** Allows updating trust scores for specific keys (rule/variable identifiers) based on success or failure outcomes. Supports weighted updates and batch updates ([`update()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:28), [`batch_update()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:47)).
*   **Trust Calculation:** Computes the mean trust score (expected value of the Beta distribution) for a given key ([`get_trust()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:79)).
*   **Confidence Interval:** Calculates a confidence interval for the trust estimate, providing a range for the true trust value ([`get_confidence_interval()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:86)).
*   **Confidence Strength:** Estimates the strength of confidence in the trust score, typically based on the number of observations ([`get_confidence_strength()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:107)).
*   **Time Decay:** Implements a mechanism to apply decay to trust scores over time, reducing the certainty of older observations ([`apply_decay()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:57), [`apply_global_decay()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:73)).
*   **State Persistence:** Supports exporting the current tracker state (alpha/beta values, timestamps) to a JSON file and importing it back ([`export_to_file()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:122), [`import_from_file()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:134)).
*   **Reporting:** Generates a summary report categorizing tracked entities by trust levels, confidence, and update recency ([`generate_report()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:157)).
*   **Timestamping:** Tracks the last update time for each entity and maintains a history of trust values over time.
*   **Thread Safety:** Operations are thread-safe using `threading.RLock` to allow for concurrent updates from different parts of the system.

## 3. Role within `core/` Directory

As a core module, the Bayesian Trust Tracker provides a fundamental service for quantifying reliability and uncertainty. This is crucial for adaptive decision-making, learning processes, and prioritizing actions within the Pulse system. Many other modules concerned with rule evaluation, variable stability, or system performance are likely consumers of the trust information provided by this tracker.

## 4. Dependencies

*   **Internal Pulse Modules:** None are explicitly imported by this module. It is designed to be a foundational service.

## 5. SPARC Principles Assessment

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:**
    *   Clearly stated and implemented. The module focuses on Bayesian trust tracking using Beta distributions.

*   **Operational Status/Completeness:**
    *   The module appears operationally complete for its defined scope, covering updates, queries, decay, persistence, and reporting.
    *   The provision of a singleton instance ([`bayesian_trust_tracker`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:213)) facilitates global use.

*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   The decay mechanism ([`apply_decay()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:57)) is straightforward; more complex decay models could be explored.
    *   Error handling in [`import_from_file()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:134) is basic (prints to console); could be enhanced with custom exceptions or structured logging.
    *   The parameters for the confidence strength calculation ([`get_confidence_strength()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:114)) are fixed; their rationale or configurability could be documented or improved.

*   **Connections & Dependencies:**
    *   Low afferent coupling (few internal dependencies).
    *   High efferent coupling is expected as many modules will likely depend on this core service.
    *   Dependencies on external libraries are standard and well-established.

*   **Function and Class Example Usages:**
    ```python
    from core.bayesian_trust_tracker import bayesian_trust_tracker

    # Initialize or load tracker data
    # bayesian_trust_tracker.import_from_file("trust_data.json")

    # Update trust for a rule or variable
    bayesian_trust_tracker.update(key="rule_X", success=True, weight=1.0)
    bayesian_trust_tracker.update(key="variable_Y", success=False, weight=1.0)

    # Get trust score
    trust_X = bayesian_trust_tracker.get_trust("rule_X")
    print(f"Trust for rule_X: {trust_X:.2f}")

    # Get confidence interval (e.g., 95%)
    lower_bound, upper_bound = bayesian_trust_tracker.get_confidence_interval("rule_X", z=1.96)
    print(f"95% CI for rule_X: [{lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f}]")

    # Get confidence strength
    strength_X = bayesian_trust_tracker.get_confidence_strength("rule_X")
    print(f"Confidence strength for rule_X: {strength_X:.2f}")

    # Apply decay globally
    # bayesian_trust_tracker.apply_global_decay(decay_factor=0.995)

    # Generate a report
    # report = bayesian_trust_tracker.generate_report(min_sample_size=10)
    # print(json.dumps(report["summary"], indent=2))

    # Export data
    # bayesian_trust_tracker.export_to_file("trust_data_updated.json")
    ```

*   **Hardcoding Issues:**
    *   Default priors for Beta distribution (`alpha=1.0, beta=1.0`) are hardcoded in [`self.stats`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:24).
    *   Default decay factor (`0.99`) and minimum count (`5`) in [`apply_decay()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:57).
    *   Default Z-score (`1.96`) for 95% confidence interval in [`get_confidence_interval()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:86).
    *   Parameters in the [`get_confidence_strength()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:114) formula (`-0.1 * (n - 10)`).
    *   Thresholds used in [`generate_report()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:157) (e.g., `0.8` for high trust, `0.2` for low trust, time thresholds for staleness).
    *   These could be made configurable via a central configuration mechanism or passed as parameters if greater flexibility is needed.

*   **Coupling Points:**
    *   The module is largely self-contained.
    *   External coupling occurs when other modules use the singleton instance or its API.
    *   File I/O for persistence ([`export_to_file()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:122), [`import_from_file()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:134)) introduces coupling to the file system and JSON format.

*   **Existing Tests:**
    *   The project structure indicates the presence of tests in `tests/test_bayesian_trust_tracker.py`. This is a positive sign for module reliability and correctness. (Note: Test content not reviewed here).

*   **Module Architecture and Flow:**
    *   The module is implemented as a single class, `BayesianTrustTracker`.
    *   A global singleton instance, [`bayesian_trust_tracker`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:213), is provided for ease of use across the system.
    *   Internal state (alpha/beta counts, last update times, timestamps) is stored in dictionaries.
    *   Thread safety is managed using `threading.RLock` to protect concurrent modifications to the state.
    *   The flow involves:
        1.  Initialization (with default priors or by loading from a file).
        2.  Receiving updates (success/failure events).
        3.  Updating alpha/beta counts for the relevant key.
        4.  Providing trust, confidence, and other metrics on demand.
        5.  Optionally applying decay.
        6.  Optionally persisting state.

*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Class `BayesianTrustTracker` and method names (e.g., [`get_trust()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:79), [`apply_decay()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:57)) are clear, descriptive, and follow Python's PEP 8 conventions (PascalCase for classes, snake_case for methods/functions/variables).
    *   Variables like `alpha` and `beta` are standard terminology for Beta distributions.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness:** The module is substantially complete for its intended purpose of Bayesian trust tracking. It provides a robust set of features including updates, querying, decay, persistence, and basic reporting.
*   **Quality:**
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Clear implementation of the Bayesian trust model.
        *   Thread-safe design is crucial for a core, potentially concurrent service.
        *   Includes persistence, which is vital for long-running systems.
        *   Good use of docstrings and type hints enhances readability and maintainability.
        *   The singleton pattern simplifies integration.
    *   **Areas for Potential Improvement:**
        *   **Configurability:** Many default values (priors, decay parameters, report thresholds) are hardcoded. Externalizing these to a configuration system would improve flexibility.
        *   **Error Handling:** Error handling for file operations could be more robust (e.g., using custom exceptions, logging framework integration).
        *   **Advanced Features (Optional):** Depending on system needs, features like more complex decay models, or integration with a centralized logging/metrics system could be considered.
        *   **Confidence Strength Formula:** The specific formula and its parameters in [`get_confidence_strength()`](core/bayesian_trust_tracker.py:114) could benefit from further justification or empirical validation within the Pulse context.

The module is well-structured and provides a critical capability for the Pulse system. Its quality is generally high, with clear areas for minor enhancements related to configurability and error handling.
