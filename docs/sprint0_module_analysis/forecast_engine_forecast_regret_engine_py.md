# Module Analysis: forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py

## 1. Purpose

The [`forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py`](../../forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py:1) module is designed to analyze past forecast performance by comparing generated forecasts against actual outcomes. Its primary goal is to identify "regrets" – instances where forecasts had low retrodiction scores – and "misses," such as failing to predict certain assets or experiencing drift in symbolic tags. This analysis is intended to feed into a learning loop to improve future forecasting accuracy.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **Regret Analysis (`analyze_regret`)**:
    *   Compares forecasts (which should include a `retrodiction_score`) against a configurable `regret_threshold`.
    *   Flags forecasts with scores below this threshold as "regrets."
    *   Logs the number of regrets found.
*   **Miss Analysis (`analyze_misses`)**:
    *   Identifies scenarios where forecasts missed key elements present in the actual outcomes.
    *   Specifically checks for:
        *   `missed_asset`: An asset present in actuals but not in the forecast.
        *   `missed_overlay`: An overlay present in actuals but not in the forecast.
        *   `symbolic_tag_drift`: Discrepancies between the `symbolic_tag` in the forecast and the actual outcome.
    *   Logs the number of misses found.
*   **Feedback Loop (`feedback_loop`)**:
    *   Currently a **stub function** intended to adjust symbolic weights or rules based on the regret analysis.
    *   Logs the number of regret cases flagged for review.
    *   Optionally writes the regret details to a specified JSON log file.
    *   Contains a `TODO` comment indicating the need for integration with model update logic.
*   **Command-Line Interface (`main`)**:
    *   Provides a CLI for running the regret and miss analysis.
    *   Accepts paths to JSON files containing forecasts and actuals.
    *   Allows configuration of the `regret_threshold`.
    *   Optionally logs regrets to a file and can be instructed to perform miss analysis.

## 3. Dependencies

### External Libraries:
*   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) (List, Dict, Any, Optional): For type hinting.
*   [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html): For application-level logging.
*   [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html): For parsing command-line arguments.
*   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): For reading and writing JSON data (forecasts, actuals, regret logs).

### Internal Pulse Modules:
*   The module does not have explicit import statements for other custom Pulse modules within [`forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py`](../../forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py:1) itself.
*   It operates on data structures (forecasts, actuals) that are presumably generated by other components within the `forecast_engine/` or broader Pulse system.

## 4. Adherence to SPARC Principles

*   **Simplicity**: The code is generally straightforward. Functions have clear responsibilities, and the logic for identifying regrets and misses is easy to follow.
*   **Iterate**: The core purpose of the module is to enable iteration and learning by analyzing past performance. The `feedback_loop` function, though a stub, directly points towards this iterative improvement cycle.
*   **Focus**: The module is well-focused on its specific task of analyzing forecast regrets and misses.
*   **Quality**:
    *   The module includes type hints, contributing to code clarity and maintainability.
    *   Logging is used to provide insights into the analysis process.
    *   Docstrings are present for functions, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
    *   The CLI (`main` function) allows for standalone execution and testing.
    *   The main quality gap is the incomplete `feedback_loop` function, which is critical for closing the learning cycle.
*   **Collaboration**: By design, this module collaborates with other parts of the forecasting system by consuming their output (forecasts, actuals) and (intending to) provide feedback to improve them.

## 5. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness**:
    *   The analysis functionalities ([`analyze_regret`](../../forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py:18) and [`analyze_misses`](../../forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py:40)) are reasonably complete for their defined scope.
    *   The crucial [`feedback_loop`](../../forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py:79) component is currently a stub and represents a significant area of incompleteness. Without its full implementation, the module cannot fully achieve its stated goal of building a learning loop.
    *   The CLI provides a good entry point for using the analysis features.
*   **Clarity**:
    *   The code is clear and well-commented with docstrings.
    *   Function and variable names are descriptive.
    *   The logic is generally easy to understand.
*   **Quality**:
    *   The existing code is of good quality, adhering to common Python best practices (type hinting, logging, modular functions).
    *   The primary concern regarding quality is the placeholder nature of the `feedback_loop`.
    *   Error handling is present for file operations in the `feedback_loop` and `main` functions.

**Recommendations**:
*   Prioritize the implementation of the [`feedback_loop`](../../forecast_engine/forecast_regret_engine.py:79) to enable the module to actively contribute to model improvement.
*   Consider expanding the types of "misses" or "regrets" that can be analyzed as the forecasting system evolves.
*   Ensure robust testing, especially for the logic that will eventually modify model weights or rules.
