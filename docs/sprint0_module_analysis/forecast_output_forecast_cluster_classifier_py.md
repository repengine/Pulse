# Module Analysis: `forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:1) module is to categorize individual forecasts into predefined "narrative clusters." This classification is based on a combination of forecast attributes:
*   `arc_label` (e.g., "Hope Surge", "Collapse Risk")
*   `symbolic_tag` (e.g., "neutral")
*   `alignment_score`
*   `certified` status (boolean)
*   `attention_score`
*   `symbolic_revision_needed` status (boolean)

The resulting cluster label (e.g., "Resilient Hope", "Volatile Collapse") is intended for use in operator summaries, grouping forecasts in digests, and informing memory retention strategies. The module also provides utilities to group forecasts by these clusters, count forecasts per cluster, and export these counts.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its defined scope. The core classification logic in [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25) is implemented with a set of rules. Helper functions for grouping, counting, and exporting are also present and seem functional. No "TODO" comments or obvious placeholders are visible in the main logic.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Scalability of Classification Logic:** The [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25) function uses a series of `if/elif/else` conditions. As the number of cluster types or the complexity of classification rules grows, this approach could become unwieldy and difficult to maintain. A more data-driven or configurable rule engine might be beneficial in the long term.
*   **Default Cluster:** The "Miscellaneous Forecast" ([`forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:44`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:44)) acts as a catch-all. While necessary, there's no immediate mechanism to review or analyze forecasts falling into this category, which might be useful for refining classification rules or identifying new cluster types.
*   **Input Validation in `classify_forecast_cluster`:** While [`group_forecasts_by_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47) and [`summarize_cluster_counts()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:58) check if the input `forecasts` is a list, the core [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25) function does not perform explicit validation on the input `forecast` dictionary (e.g., checking if it's a dict, or if expected keys exist, though `.get()` provides default values).
*   **Export Path Configuration:** The [`export_cluster_summary()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68) function takes a `path` argument, but there's no integration with a centralized path management system like [`core.path_registry`](core/path_registry.py:1) for default export locations.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Module Imports:**
    *   None explicitly listed beyond standard Python libraries for the core logic.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `typing` (List, Dict): For type hinting.
    *   `logging`: For basic logging.
    *   `json`: Used locally within [`export_cluster_summary()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68) for writing JSON files.
*   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    *   The module operates on `forecast` dictionaries, expecting keys like `arc_label`, `symbolic_tag`, `alignment_score`, `certified`, `attention_score`, and `symbolic_revision_needed`.
    *   It adds a `narrative_cluster` key to forecast dictionaries when processed by [`group_forecasts_by_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47).
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   The [`export_cluster_summary()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68) function writes a JSON file to a specified path.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **[`classify_forecast_cluster(forecast: Dict) -> str`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25):**
    ```python
    my_forecast = {
        "arc_label": "Hope Surge",
        "alignment_score": 85, # Note: original code uses 0.9, example uses 85 for > 80
        "certified": True,
        "symbolic_tag": "positive",
        "attention_score": 0.6,
        "symbolic_revision_needed": False
    }
    cluster_label = classify_forecast_cluster(my_forecast)
    # cluster_label would be "Resilient Hope"
    ```
*   **[`group_forecasts_by_cluster(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47):**
    ```python
    forecast_list = [
        {"arc_label": "Hope Surge", "alignment_score": 90, "certified": True},
        {"arc_label": "Collapse Risk", "attention_score": 0.8},
        {"arc_label": "Hope Surge", "alignment_score": 82, "certified": True}
    ]
    grouped = group_forecasts_by_cluster(forecast_list)
    # grouped would be:
    # {
    #     "Resilient Hope": [
    #         {"arc_label": "Hope Surge", "alignment_score": 90, "certified": True, "narrative_cluster": "Resilient Hope"},
    #         {"arc_label": "Hope Surge", "alignment_score": 82, "certified": True, "narrative_cluster": "Resilient Hope"}
    #     ],
    #     "Volatile Collapse": [
    #         {"arc_label": "Collapse Risk", "attention_score": 0.8, "narrative_cluster": "Volatile Collapse"}
    #     ]
    # }
    # Each forecast in the lists will also have a "narrative_cluster" key added.
    ```
*   **[`summarize_cluster_counts(forecasts: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, int]`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:58):**
    ```python
    forecast_list = [
        {"arc_label": "Hope Surge", "alignment_score": 90, "certified": True},
        {"arc_label": "Collapse Risk", "attention_score": 0.8},
        {"symbolic_tag": "neutral", "alignment_score": 50}
    ]
    counts = summarize_cluster_counts(forecast_list)
    # counts would be: {"Resilient Hope": 1, "Volatile Collapse": 1, "Neutral Drift": 1}
    ```
*   **[`export_cluster_summary(counts: Dict[str, int], path: str)`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68):**
    ```python
    cluster_counts = {"Resilient Hope": 10, "Volatile Collapse": 5}
    export_cluster_summary(cluster_counts, "path/to/summary.json")
    # A file "summary.json" would be created with the counts.
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Classification Rules and Thresholds:** The core logic in [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25) has several hardcoded elements:
    *   Specific string values for `arc_label` (e.g., `"hope surge"`, `"collapse risk"`).
    *   Specific string values for `symbolic_tag` (e.g., `"neutral"`).
    *   Threshold values for scores (e.g., `align > 80`, `attn > 0.7`, `align < 60`).
    *   The boolean checks for `cert` and `revision`.
    These rules are central to the module's function and making them configurable (e.g., via a JSON/YAML configuration file) would significantly improve flexibility and maintainability.
*   **Cluster Labels:** The returned string labels (e.g., `"Resilient Hope"`, `"Volatile Collapse"`, `"Miscellaneous Forecast"`) are hardcoded.
*   **Logger Name:** `logger = logging.getLogger("forecast_cluster_classifier")` ([`forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:22`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:22)) uses a hardcoded logger name. Using `__name__` is a common Python practice for more modular logging.
*   **Default Values in `.get()`:** The `.get()` method calls in [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25) use hardcoded default values (e.g., `""`, `0`, `False`). While this prevents `KeyError`s, the choice of defaults might influence classification if keys are missing.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Forecast Dictionary Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected keys and data types within the input `forecast` dictionaries (e.g., `arc_label`, `alignment_score`, `certified`). Changes to this structure in other parts of the system could break the classifier.
*   **Implicit Schema:** The classification rules imply a specific schema and range of values for the input forecast attributes.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   An inline test function [`_test_forecast_cluster_classifier()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:78) is present, executed when the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
*   This test uses a small list of `dummy` forecast dictionaries to check the [`group_forecasts_by_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47) and [`summarize_cluster_counts()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:58) functions, primarily asserting that the outputs are dictionaries.
*   It does not explicitly verify the correctness of individual cluster assignments for varied inputs or edge cases for [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25).
*   No separate formal test file (e.g., using `pytest` or `unittest`) is indicated, suggesting a gap in comprehensive, isolated unit testing.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module is procedural, consisting of several functions that operate on forecast data. It does not define any classes.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   Classification logic: [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25)
    *   Grouping utility: [`group_forecasts_by_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47)
    *   Counting utility: [`summarize_cluster_counts()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:58)
    *   Export utility: [`export_cluster_summary()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68)
*   **Primary Data/Control Flows:**
    1.  A list of forecast dictionaries is provided as input.
    2.  For each forecast:
        a.  [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25) is called.
        b.  This function retrieves various attributes from the forecast dictionary (using `.get()` with defaults).
        c.  It applies a series of `if/elif/else` conditions based on these attributes to determine a string label for the narrative cluster.
        d.  This label is returned.
    3.  [`group_forecasts_by_cluster()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47) iterates through forecasts, classifies each, adds the `narrative_cluster` label to the forecast dictionary, and groups them into a dictionary where keys are cluster labels and values are lists of forecasts.
    4.  [`summarize_cluster_counts()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:58) iterates, classifies, and returns a dictionary of cluster labels to their respective counts.
    5.  [`export_cluster_summary()`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68) takes a counts dictionary and writes it to a JSON file.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Names like [`classify_forecast_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:25), [`group_forecasts_by_cluster`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:47), [`summarize_cluster_counts`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:58), and [`export_cluster_summary`](forecast_output/forecast_cluster_classifier.py:68) are descriptive, use `snake_case`, and adhere to PEP 8. The private test function `_test_forecast_cluster_classifier` uses a leading underscore, which is conventional.
*   **Variables:** Local variables (e.g., `arc`, `tag`, `align`, `cert`, `attn`, `revision`, `fc`, `clusters`, `counts`) and parameters are generally clear and use `snake_case`.
*   **Module Name:** `forecast_cluster_classifier.py` is descriptive.
*   **Overall:** Naming conventions are consistent and follow Python best practices (PEP 8). The names appear human-readable and semantically appropriate. The "Author: Pulse AI Engine" and "Version: v1.0.0" in the docstring suggest AI involvement in generation or boilerplate, but the code itself follows standard conventions.
