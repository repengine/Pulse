# Module Analysis: `recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of this module, encapsulated by the `RecursiveTrainingRecovery` class, is to provide robust recovery mechanisms for errors and failures encountered during recursive training processes. It aims to handle various failure scenarios by implementing strategies such as rolling back to a known safe state, retrying failed operations, and restoring the system to a stable condition to allow training to continue or terminate gracefully.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be a foundational or skeletal implementation.
*   The core recovery logic within the [`recover()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23) method and particularly the [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) method contain placeholder comments (e.g., "`# Implement rollback logic: restore checkpoints, revert model weights, etc.`" on line 58 and "`# Simulate retry logic`" on line 41). This clearly indicates that the actual, detailed recovery actions are not yet implemented.
*   Configuration options like `max_retries` and `rollback_enabled` are present, suggesting a basic framework for these features is in place, but their effectiveness is limited by the unimplemented underlying logic.
*   The module logs its actions but lacks the specific implementation details for those actions.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Actual Rollback Logic:** The most significant gap is the absence of a concrete implementation for the [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) method. This method needs to be fleshed out with specific actions such as restoring model checkpoints, reverting database states, clearing temporary data, or any other steps required to return the system to a consistent state.
*   **Specific Error Handling Strategies:** The current [`recover()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23) method handles all exceptions generically. Future development should consider implementing different recovery strategies tailored to specific types of exceptions (e.g., `IOError`, `MemoryError`, `ConvergenceError`).
*   **Detailed Retry Logic:** The "Simulate retry logic" comment within [`recover()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:41) needs to be replaced with actual retry mechanisms. This could include exponential backoff, conditional retries based on error type, or checks for resource availability before attempting a retry.
*   **Context Utilization:** The `context` parameter (type `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]`) is passed to [`recover()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23) and [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50), but its expected structure and how it would be utilized by the (currently unimplemented) recovery actions are not defined. Clear documentation or a defined schema for this context dictionary is needed.
*   **Safe State Management:** While the module aims for "safe state restoration," the specifics of what constitutes a "safe state" and how it's defined, snapshotted, and managed (e.g., checkpointing frequency, storage mechanisms) are not detailed within this module. This would likely require interaction with other parts of the training infrastructure.
*   **Success/Failure Criteria for Retry:** The current simulated retry always assumes success. Real retry logic would need to determine if the retried operation was actually successful.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:**
    *   None are explicitly imported within this file. The class `RecursiveTrainingRecovery` is self-contained in its direct dependencies on other project modules.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html): Used for logging information, errors, and recovery attempts throughout the module.
    *   `typing` ([`Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any), [`Dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Dict), [`Optional`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Optional)): Used for type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    *   Implicitly, a fully implemented version would interact significantly with modules responsible for:
        *   Model state management (e.g., saving/loading checkpoints).
        *   Data pipeline state.
        *   Configuration management (for recovery parameters).
    *   The `context` dictionary passed to recovery methods is the intended vehicle for carrying information necessary for these interactions.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** Potentially model checkpoint files, state serialization files, or configuration files if the rollback and recovery logic were fully implemented.
    *   **Output:** Log files generated by the `logging` module, detailing recovery attempts and outcomes.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### Class `RecursiveTrainingRecovery`

```python
import logging
from recursive_training.error_handling.recovery import RecursiveTrainingRecovery

# Configure basic logging for demonstration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Example 1: Initialize with default configuration
recovery_handler_default = RecursiveTrainingRecovery()

# Example 2: Initialize with custom configuration
custom_config = {
    "max_retries": 5,
    "rollback_enabled": False
}
recovery_handler_custom = RecursiveTrainingRecovery(config=custom_config)

# Example 3: Simulating an error and recovery attempt
training_context_data = {
    "current_epoch": 10,
    "model_id": "model_v1_alpha",
    "last_checkpoint_path": "/mnt/checkpoints/model_v1_alpha_epoch9.pt"
}

try:
    # Simulate a part of a training loop
    print("Simulating a training operation...")
    # ... training operation that might fail ...
    raise ValueError("Simulated training error: Loss is NaN")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    print("Attempting recovery...")
    # Use the default handler
    recovery_succeeded = recovery_handler_default.recover(e, context=training_context_data)

    if recovery_succeeded:
        print("Recovery attempt reported as successful. Training might proceed.")
        # ... logic to continue or retry the operation ...
    else:
        print("Recovery attempt reported as failed. Manual intervention likely required.")
        # ... logic to escalate or terminate ...

# Get the status of the last recovery operation
status_report = recovery_handler_default.get_recovery_status()
print(f"Last recovery status: {status_report['last_recovery_status']}")

# Example with custom handler
try:
    raise RuntimeError("Another simulated critical error")
except Exception as e:
    recovery_handler_custom.recover(e, context={"detail": "Critical failure"})
    print(f"Custom handler status: {recovery_handler_custom.get_recovery_status()}")

```

### Method [`__init__(self, config=None)`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:16)
Initializes the recovery handler with optional configuration for `max_retries` and `rollback_enabled`.

### Method [`recover(self, error, context=None)`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23)
The main entry point for attempting recovery from a given `error`. It uses the provided `context` to inform recovery actions. It will loop up to `max_retries` times. In each attempt, it tries to [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) (if enabled) and then (currently) simulates a retry.

### Method [`rollback_to_safe_state(self, context=None)`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50)
Intended to roll the system back to a last known good state using information from the `context`. Currently, this is a placeholder and logs that it's performing a rollback.

### Method [`get_recovery_status(self)`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:61)
Returns a dictionary containing the status (`"success"` or `"failed"`) of the most recent recovery attempt.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Configuration Values:**
    *   `self.max_retries = self.config.get("max_retries", 3)` ([`recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:19`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:19)): The default value `3` for maximum retries is hardcoded.
    *   `self.rollback_enabled = self.config.get("rollback_enabled", True)` ([`recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:20`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:20)): The default value `True` for enabling rollback is hardcoded.
*   **Logger Name:**
    *   `self.logger = logging.getLogger("RecursiveTrainingRecovery")` ([`recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:18`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:18)): The logger name `"RecursiveTrainingRecovery"` is hardcoded. While common, deriving it from `self.__class__.__name__` could offer more flexibility if subclassed.
*   **Status Strings:**
    *   `self.last_recovery_status = "success"` ([`recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:43`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:43))
    *   `self.last_recovery_status = "failed"` ([`recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:47`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:47))
    *   The strings `"success"` and `"failed"` used for `last_recovery_status` are hardcoded. Using an `Enum` or constants could improve type safety and reduce the risk of typos if these statuses are checked elsewhere.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Configuration Dictionary (`config`):** The module's behavior (e.g., `max_retries`, `rollback_enabled`) is directly coupled to the structure and keys within the `config` dictionary passed during initialization. Changes to these keys or their expected values would require updates here.
*   **External State Management Systems (Implicit):** A fully implemented [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) method would create significant coupling with external systems or modules responsible for managing model checkpoints, data states, or other recoverable components of the training pipeline. The `context` dictionary serves as the primary interface for this coupling.
*   **Logging Infrastructure:** The module is coupled with Python's standard `logging` module. While this is a common and flexible coupling, any project-wide changes to logging configuration or practices would affect this module.
*   **Error/Exception Types:** While it currently catches generic `Exception`, more specific recovery logic would couple it to the specific exception types raised by the training process.

## 8. Existing Tests

To assess existing tests, one would typically look for a corresponding test file, likely located at `tests/recursive_training/error_handling/test_recovery.py`.

Given the current state of [`recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:1) with placeholder logic:
*   **Likely Testable Aspects:**
    *   Correct initialization with default and custom configurations (verifying `max_retries` and `rollback_enabled` are set).
    *   The retry loop in [`recover()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23) executes the configured number of times upon repeated simulated failures within the recovery attempt.
    *   [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) is called (or its log message is emitted) if `rollback_enabled` is true during a recovery attempt.
    *   [`get_recovery_status()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:61) correctly returns the last set status ("success" or "failed").
    *   Logging calls are made as expected.
*   **Gaps in Testability (due to incomplete implementation):**
    *   The actual effects of rollback cannot be tested until [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) is implemented.
    *   The success or failure of a "retried" operation cannot be meaningfully tested as the retry is only simulated.
    *   Handling of different `context` structures and their impact on recovery.

A file [`tests/recursive_training/error_handling/test_recovery.py`](tests/recursive_training/error_handling/test_recovery.py) exists, suggesting tests are present. The coverage and nature of these tests would need to be reviewed in that file.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:**
    *   The module defines a single class, [`RecursiveTrainingRecovery`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:11).
    *   The [`__init__()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:16) method initializes instance variables including configuration parameters (`max_retries`, `rollback_enabled`) and a logger. It also initializes `last_recovery_status`.
    *   The [`recover()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23) method is the primary public interface for initiating a recovery process. It orchestrates retry attempts and calls for rollback.
    *   The [`rollback_to_safe_state()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50) method is a (currently placeholder) protected-like method intended to perform the actual state restoration.
    *   The [`get_recovery_status()`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:61) method provides a way to query the outcome of the last recovery operation.
*   **Control Flow (within `recover()` method):**
    1.  The method is called with an `error` (Exception) and an optional `context` dictionary.
    2.  It logs the initiation of the recovery process.
    3.  It enters a `for` loop, iterating from `1` to `self.max_retries`.
    4.  Inside the loop (each iteration is a recovery "attempt"):
        a.  A `try` block attempts the recovery actions.
        b.  It logs the current attempt number.
        c.  If `self.rollback_enabled` is `True`, it calls [`self.rollback_to_safe_state(context)`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50). (Currently, this is a placeholder that just logs).
        d.  It logs that it's "Retrying operation after recovery..." (This is a simulation of a retry).
        e.  Sets `self.last_recovery_status` to `"success"`.
        f.  Returns `True`, indicating the (simulated) recovery was successful.
        g.  If an `Exception` occurs during the `try` block of a recovery attempt (e.g., if the `rollback_to_safe_state` itself failed, though currently it can't), it's caught.
        h.  The failure of the recovery attempt is logged. The loop continues to the next attempt if `max_retries` has not been reached.
    5.  If the loop completes without returning `True` (meaning all recovery attempts failed), `self.last_recovery_status` is set to `"failed"`.
    6.  The method returns `False`.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:**
    *   [`RecursiveTrainingRecovery`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:11): Follows PascalCase, which is the standard Python convention (PEP 8) for class names.
*   **Method Names:**
    *   [`__init__`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:16), [`recover`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:23), [`rollback_to_safe_state`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:50), [`get_recovery_status`](recursive_training/error_handling/recovery.py:61): Use snake_case, adhering to PEP 8 for function and method names.
*   **Variable Names:**
    *   `config`, `logger`, `max_retries`, `rollback_enabled`, `last_recovery_status`, `error`, `context`, `attempt`: All use snake_case, which is appropriate for local and instance variables as per PEP 8.
*   **Logger Name:**
    *   `"RecursiveTrainingRecovery"` (used in [`logging.getLogger()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.getLogger:18)): Matches the class name, which is a common and good practice for clarity.
*   **Overall Consistency:**
    *   The naming conventions are consistent throughout the module and align well with PEP 8.
    *   Names are generally descriptive and clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `max_retries`, `rollback_enabled`).
    *   No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations from standard Python naming practices are apparent.
