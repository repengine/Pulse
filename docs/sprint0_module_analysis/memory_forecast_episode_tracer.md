# SPARC Analysis Report: memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py

**File Path:** [`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1)
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-13

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (SPARC: Specification)

The primary role of the `forecast_episode_tracer.py` module is to provide utilities for tracking and analyzing the symbolic lineage and mutations of forecasts across different versions. As stated in its docstring ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:6-7`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:6-7)), it is "Useful for reconstructing memory chains, repair ancestry, or symbolic flip paths." This involves functions to trace ancestry, compare versions, build chains of related forecasts, and summarize changes (drift) within these chains.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for the functions it defines. There are no explicit "TODO" comments or obvious placeholders suggesting unfinished core logic within the provided functions. Each function has a clear purpose and implementation.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Handling of Branched Lineage:** The [`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48) function, when reconstructing an episode, assumes a linear progression by always selecting the first child: `current_id = lineage[0] if lineage else None` ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:65`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:65)). If a forecast can have multiple children (representing branched evolution or alternative repairs), this function would only trace one path. Future enhancements might require more sophisticated logic to handle or represent branching.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling is minimal. For instance, if a `trace_id` in a lineage path is not found in the `id_map` within [`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48), the loop simply breaks ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:62`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:62)) without explicit error reporting or logging. More robust error handling (e.g., raising custom exceptions, logging warnings) could be beneficial.
*   **Configurability of Comparison Fields:** The fields used for comparison in [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30) are hardcoded ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:38`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:38)). If the set of relevant symbolic fields changes or expands, the module would require modification.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   `json`: Standard Python library ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:13`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:13)). (Note: `json` is imported but not explicitly used in the provided code snippet. It might be intended for future use or was part of a previous version.)
    *   `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`: Standard Python library for type hinting ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:14`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:14)).
*   **Interactions (Data Structures):**
    *   The module heavily relies on a specific dictionary structure for "forecast" objects. It expects keys such as:
        *   `"lineage"` (dictionary)
            *   `"ancestors"` (list of strings)
            *   `"children"` (list of strings)
        *   `"trace_id"` (string)
        *   `"symbolic_tag"` (any)
        *   `"arc_label"` (any)
        *   `"confidence"` (any)
        *   `"alignment_score"` (any)
        *   `"license_status"` (any)
    *   This implies a dependency on the system component(s) that generate or manage these forecast dictionaries.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   The module does not directly interact with the file system for reading or writing files. It operates on in-memory Python dictionaries and lists.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

This module contains functions, not classes.

*   **[`trace_forecast_lineage(forecast: Dict) -> List[str]`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17)**
    *   **Description:** Extracts and returns a list of ancestor trace IDs from a given forecast's metadata.
    *   **Example:**
        \`\`\`python
        forecast_data = {
            "trace_id": "forecast_C",
            "lineage": {
                "ancestors": ["forecast_A", "forecast_B"],
                "children": []
            },
            "symbolic_tag": "stable"
        }
        ancestors = trace_forecast_lineage(forecast_data)
        # ancestors would be: ["forecast_A", "forecast_B"]
        \`\`\`

*   **[`compare_forecast_versions(a: Dict, b: Dict) -> Dict`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30)**
    *   **Description:** Compares two forecast dictionaries based on a predefined set of symbolic fields and returns a dictionary detailing the differences.
    *   **Example:**
        \`\`\`python
        forecast_v1 = {"symbolic_tag": "initial_hypothesis", "confidence": 0.7, "arc_label": "positive_correlation"}
        forecast_v2 = {"symbolic_tag": "revised_hypothesis", "confidence": 0.7, "arc_label": "strong_positive_correlation"}
        differences = compare_forecast_versions(forecast_v1, forecast_v2)
        # differences would be:
        # {
        #     "symbolic_tag": {"before": "initial_hypothesis", "after": "revised_hypothesis"},
        #     "arc_label": {"before": "positive_correlation", "after": "strong_positive_correlation"}
        # }
        \`\`\`

*   **[`build_episode_chain(forecasts: List[Dict], root_id: str) -> List[Dict]`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48)**
    *   **Description:** Reconstructs a chronological chain of forecasts starting from a `root_id`, by following the `children` links. Assumes a linear chain (follows the first child if multiple exist).
    *   **Example:**
        \`\`\`python
        f1 = {"trace_id": "root", "symbolic_tag": "A", "lineage": {"children": ["child1"]}}
        f2 = {"trace_id": "child1", "symbolic_tag": "B", "lineage": {"children": ["child2"]}}
        f3 = {"trace_id": "child2", "symbolic_tag": "C", "lineage": {"children": []}}
        all_forecasts = [f3, f1, f2] # Order doesn't matter for input list
        chain = build_episode_chain(all_forecasts, "root")
        # chain would be: [
        #   {"trace_id": "root", "symbolic_tag": "A", "lineage": {"children": ["child1"]}},
        #   {"trace_id": "child1", "symbolic_tag": "B", "lineage": {"children": ["child2"]}},
        #   {"trace_id": "child2", "symbolic_tag": "C", "lineage": {"children": []}}
        # ]
        \`\`\`

*   **[`summarize_lineage_drift(chain: List[Dict]) -> Dict`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70)**
    *   **Description:** Analyzes a chain of forecasts (presumably ordered chronologically) to quantify changes ("flips") in `symbolic_tag` and `arc_label`, and calculates a `symbolic_stability_score`.
    *   **Example:**
        \`\`\`python
        chain_data = [
            {"symbolic_tag": "Alpha", "arc_label": "X1"},
            {"symbolic_tag": "Beta", "arc_label": "X1"}, # Tag flip
            {"symbolic_tag": "Beta", "arc_label": "X2"}  # Arc flip
        ]
        drift_summary = summarize_lineage_drift(chain_data)
        # drift_summary would be:
        # {
        #     "total_versions": 3,
        #     "tag_flips": 1,
        #     "arc_flips": 1,
        #     "symbolic_stability_score": 0.0 # 1 - ((1+1) / max(3-1, 1)) = 1 - (2/2) = 0.0
        # }
        \`\`\`

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

*   **Field List for Comparison:** In [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30), the list of fields to compare is hardcoded: `fields = ["symbolic_tag", "arc_label", "confidence", "alignment_score", "license_status"]` ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:38`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:38)). This limits flexibility if new symbolic attributes need comparison or if this list needs to be dynamic.
*   **Dictionary Keys:** Throughout the module, string literals are used to access dictionary keys (e.g., `"lineage"`, `"ancestors"`, `"trace_id"`, `"symbolic_tag"`). While common, this creates a form of hardcoding an expected data structure. Changes to these key names in the input data would break the module.
*   **Rounding Precision:** In [`summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70), the `symbolic_stability_score` is rounded to 3 decimal places: `round(..., 3)` ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:90`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:90)). The number `3` is a magic number for precision.
*   **No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or file paths were found.**

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Forecast Dictionary Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the specific structure and key names of the forecast dictionaries it processes. Any deviation in this structure would likely lead to `KeyError` exceptions or incorrect behavior.
*   **Linear Chain Assumption:** [`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48) is coupled to the assumption of a linear forecast evolution (or at least, it only traces one path if branches exist) by always taking `lineage[0]` ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:65`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:65)).
*   **Predefined Comparison Fields:** [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30) is coupled to the hardcoded list of fields it compares.

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

No test files or test specifications for [`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) were provided as part of this analysis.
Given the module's purpose in tracking lineage and mutations, comprehensive unit tests are crucial. Potential test cases should cover:
*   **[`trace_forecast_lineage`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17):**
    *   Forecasts with and without ancestors.
    *   Forecasts missing the `"lineage"` or `"ancestors"` keys (graceful handling).
*   **[`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30):**
    *   Identical forecasts.
    *   Forecasts with differences in one, multiple, or all monitored fields.
    *   Forecasts missing some of the monitored fields.
*   **[`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48):**
    *   Empty list of forecasts.
    *   `root_id` not found.
    *   Valid linear chains of varying lengths.
    *   Chains with broken links (a `trace_id` in `children` not present in `forecasts`).
    *   Circular dependencies (if possible in the data model, though current logic might loop indefinitely).
*   **[`summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70):**
    *   Chains with 0, 1, or multiple forecasts.
    *   Chains with no drift, only tag flips, only arc flips, and both.
    *   Forecasts in the chain missing `"symbolic_tag"` or `"arc_label"`.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

*   **Structure:** The module is a collection of four distinct utility functions. It does not define any classes. This flat structure is suitable for a set of related, stateless operations.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Functions typically receive one or more forecast dictionaries (or a list of them) as input.
    2.  They process these dictionaries by accessing specific keys and comparing values.
    3.  They return new data structures: lists of strings (trace IDs), a dictionary of differences, a list of re-ordered forecast dictionaries (the chain), or a dictionary of summary statistics.
*   **Control Flow:**
    *   [`trace_forecast_lineage`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17): Direct dictionary access using `.get()` for safe retrieval.
    *   [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30): Iterates through a hardcoded list of fields, performing comparisons.
    *   [`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48): First, it builds a hash map (`id_map`) for quick forecast lookup by `trace_id`. Then, it enters a `while` loop, starting from `root_id` and traversing through `children` links until the chain ends or a link is broken.
    *   [`summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70): Iterates through the provided chain (from the second element) comparing each forecast with its predecessor.
*   **Key Components:** The functions themselves are the key components. There's no internal state maintained within the module between function calls.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

*   **Function Names:**
    *   [`trace_forecast_lineage`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17)
    *   [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30)
    *   [`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:48)
    *   [`summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70)
    These are clear, descriptive, and follow PEP 8 (snake_case).
*   **Variable Names:**
    *   Generally clear and understandable within their local scope (e.g., `forecast`, `diffs`, `fields`, `id_map`, `chain`, `current_id`, `tag_flips`, `arc_flips`).
    *   `a` and `b` in [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30) are common for two items being compared but could be more explicit (e.g., `forecast_a`, `forecast_b`).
    *   `f` for field name in a loop ([`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:40`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:40)) is acceptable.
    *   `fc` for forecast in [`build_episode_chain`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:60) is a reasonable abbreviation in context.
*   **Consistency:** Naming is consistent throughout the module.
*   **AI Assumption Errors:** No obvious errors in naming that would mislead an AI.
*   **Docstrings:** Each function has a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values, which aids maintainability. The module also has a top-level docstring.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

*   **Specification:**
    *   **Adherence:** Good. The module's overall purpose and each function's role are clearly specified via docstrings.
    *   **Gaps:** None significant at the functional specification level.
*   **Modularity/Architecture:**
    *   **Adherence:** Good. The module is a cohesive set of utility functions focused on a specific task (forecast lineage and mutation). It's architecturally simple, which is appropriate.
    *   **Gaps:** The main architectural dependency is the implicit contract of the forecast dictionary structure.
*   **Refinement:**
    *   **Testability:**
        *   **Adherence:** Functions are pure (no side effects beyond returning values) and thus inherently testable.
        *   **Gaps:** No tests were provided for review. Test coverage for edge cases and varied data inputs is essential.
    *   **Security:**
        *   **Adherence:** Excellent. The module does not handle sensitive data, file paths directly, or external calls that would pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets.
        *   **Gaps:** None identified.
    *   **Maintainability:**
        *   **Adherence:** Good. Code is clear, well-commented with docstrings, and uses consistent, descriptive naming.
        *   **Gaps:** The hardcoded field list in [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:30) and the magic number for rounding in [`summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:70) are minor maintainability concerns. The tight coupling to the forecast dictionary structure means changes to that structure elsewhere would necessitate changes here.
*   **No Hardcoding (Critical):**
    *   **Adherence:** Partially compliant. While no secrets or critical paths are hardcoded, there are instances of hardcoded field lists and a magic number for rounding precision. The reliance on specific string keys for dictionary access is also a form of hardcoding the data structure.
    *   **Violations:**
        1.  `fields = ["symbolic_tag", "arc_label", "confidence", "alignment_score", "license_status"]` in [`compare_forecast_versions`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:38).
        2.  Rounding precision `3` in [`summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:90).

Overall, the module is well-structured for its intended purpose but could benefit from increased robustness in error handling, flexibility in configuration (e.g., for comparison fields), and comprehensive unit testing.
