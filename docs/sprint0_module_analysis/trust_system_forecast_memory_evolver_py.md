# Module Analysis: `trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py`

**Version:** v0.100.5 (as per docstring)
**Location:** `trust_system/`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:1) is to analyze historical regret data and forecast memory to adapt and improve the Pulse system's trust mechanisms. It specifically focuses on adjusting trust weights associated with rules based on their performance (i.e., how often they are implicated in regrets) and identifying frequently problematic forecast traces. This contributes to the evolution of symbolic weightings within the system.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally functional for its defined scope. It can:
*   Load regret data from a JSONL file ([`load_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:25)).
*   Count patterns in regrets based on symbolic arcs and rule IDs ([`count_regret_patterns`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:37)).
*   Adjust trust weights in a rule fingerprint file ([`adjust_rule_trust_weights`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:51)).
*   Identify forecast traces that repeatedly appear in regrets ([`flag_repeat_forecasts`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:76)).
*   Provide a summary of its operations ([`evolve_memory_from_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:85)).
*   Offers a basic CLI interface for execution ([`if __name__ == "__main__":`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:100)).

There are no explicit `TODO` or `FIXME` comments. However, the error handling in [`load_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:33) (`except: continue`) is broad and might suppress useful error information during JSON parsing.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Advanced Regret Analysis:** The current analysis relies on simple frequency counts. More sophisticated methods could be employed to find complex correlations or causal links within regret data.
*   **Dynamic Trust Adjustment:** The trust weight adjustment is a fixed decrement ([`-0.1`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:67)). This could be made more adaptive, potentially based on the magnitude or impact of the regret.
*   **Symbolic Arc Weight Evolution:** The module counts `arc_patterns` ([`count_regret_patterns`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:47)) and the module's purpose mentions evolving "symbolic weightings," but there's no explicit mechanism implemented to adjust weights or take action based on these symbolic arc patterns beyond reporting them.
*   **Variable-Level Regret Detail:** The docstring mentions aggregating patterns including "variable" ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:10`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:10)), but the implementation primarily focuses on `arc_label` and `rule_id`. A deeper analysis at the variable level within regrets is not apparent.
*   **Operator Interaction/Approval:** While a summary is generated ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:13`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:13)), there's no built-in workflow for an operator to review, approve, or reject the proposed changes to trust weights before they are persisted.
*   **Deeper Forecast Memory Integration:** The interaction with "forecast memory" is mainly through identifying problematic `trace_id`s. The module doesn't seem to delve into the structure or content of the forecast memory itself for evolution.
*   **Configuration for Thresholds:** Thresholds for trust adjustment ([`threshold: int = 2`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:51)) and repeat forecast flagging ([`min_count: int = 2`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:76)) are hardcoded as default parameters. These could be made configurable.

    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **File Paths:**
    *   `REGRET_LOG = "data/regret_chain.jsonl"` ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:22`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:22))
    *   `FINGERPRINT_FILE = "data/rule_fingerprints.json"` ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:23`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:23))
*   **Numerical Values/Thresholds:**
    *   Default threshold for rule adjustment in [`adjust_rule_trust_weights`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:51) is `2`.
    *   Trust decrement value is fixed at `0.1` ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:67`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:67)).
    *   Minimum trust weight after adjustment is `0.1` ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:67`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:67)).
    *   Default minimum count for flagging repeat forecasts in [`flag_repeat_forecasts`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:76) is `2`.
*   **String Literals:**
    *   `"Unknown"` is used as a default for missing `arc_label` or `rule_id` in regrets ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:42-43`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:42-43), [`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:63`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:63)).

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Data Format Dependency:** The module is tightly coupled to the specific JSON structures of:
    *   [`data/regret_chain.jsonl`](data/regret_chain.jsonl): Expects keys such as `arc_label`, `rule_id`, and `trace_id`.
    *   [`data/rule_fingerprints.json`](data/rule_fingerprints.json): Expects a dictionary mapping rule IDs to objects that contain a `trust_weight` attribute.
*   **External Data Source Reliability:** The quality and completeness of the evolution process depend heavily on the data logged in [`data/regret_chain.jsonl`](data/regret_chain.jsonl) by other parts of the system.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   No dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/trust_system/test_forecast_memory_evolver.py`) was found in the project structure provided.
*   The module itself does not contain inline unit tests or assertions beyond the basic CLI execution flow.
*   Given its reliance on file I/O and specific data formats, unit tests using mock data and a mocked file system would be highly beneficial to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module operates through a sequence of functions, primarily orchestrated by [`evolve_memory_from_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:85):

1.  **Load Regrets:** [`load_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:25) reads regret events from the [`REGRET_LOG`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:22) file.
2.  **Count Patterns:** [`count_regret_patterns`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:37) processes the loaded regrets to count occurrences of different `arc_label`s and `rule_id`s.
3.  **Adjust Trust Weights:** [`adjust_rule_trust_weights`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:51) takes the rule patterns, loads the current rule fingerprints from [`FINGERPRINT_FILE`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:23), reduces the `trust_weight` for rules appearing in regrets above a certain threshold, and then writes the updated fingerprints back to the file.
4.  **Flag Forecasts:** [`flag_repeat_forecasts`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:76) identifies `trace_id`s that appear multiple times in the regret data.
5.  **Summarize:** The main function [`evolve_memory_from_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:85) compiles a dictionary summarizing the actions taken and patterns found.
6.  **CLI Interface:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:100`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:100)) allows users to run either a summary of regret patterns or the full evolution process via command-line arguments.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Adhere to PEP 8 (e.g., [`load_regrets`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:25), [`adjust_rule_trust_weights`](trust_system/forecast_memory_evolver.py:51)).
*   **Variables:** Mostly use snake_case (e.g., `arc_count`, `rule_stats`, `new_trust`). Short, single-letter variables (`r`, `f`) are used appropriately in limited scopes.
*   **Constants:** Use uppercase snake_case (e.g., `REGRET_LOG`, `FINGERPRINT_FILE`), following Python conventions.
*   **Module Name:** `forecast_memory_evolver.py` is descriptive of its function.
*   **Overall:** Naming is consistent and clear, appearing to follow standard Python practices (PEP 8). There are no obvious signs of AI-generated naming errors or significant deviations from common conventions.
