# Module Analysis: `interfaces/symbolic_interface.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`interfaces/symbolic_interface.py`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:1) module is to define an abstract base class (ABC), [`SymbolicInterface`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:4), which serves as a contract for classes that handle symbolic operations within the system. These operations include applying symbolic upgrades to forecasts, rewriting forecasts based on upgrade plans, generating traces of upgrades, logging symbolic mutations, and computing/reporting on the alignment of symbolic tags with variables.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

As an abstract base class, this module is a blueprint and not directly operational. It defines a set of abstract methods that concrete subclasses must implement. All methods are marked with `@abstractmethod` and contain only a `pass` statement, which is appropriate for an ABC. The interface itself appears complete for its defined purpose.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Module Extensiveness:** The module itself, as an interface definition, is concise and focused. There are no immediate signs it was intended to be more extensive *as an interface*.
*   **Logical Next Steps:** The logical next step is the creation of one or more concrete classes that implement the [`SymbolicInterface`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:4). Without these implementations, the interface serves no runtime purpose.
*   **Development Deviation:** There are no indications of development deviation within this module; it clearly defines a contract.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`abc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html): Used for creating abstract base classes ([`ABC`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:1), [`abstractmethod`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:1)).
    *   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html): Used for type hinting ([`Any`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:2), [`Dict`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:2), [`List`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:2)).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:** Concrete implementations of this interface will interact with other modules by processing forecast data (typically `Dict`), upgrade maps/plans (`Dict`), and trace data (`Dict`).
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   The [`log_symbolic_mutation()`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:18) method has a default `path` parameter for a log file: `"logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl"`.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The [`SymbolicInterface`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:4) class is an ABC and is not intended to be instantiated directly. Instead, other classes will inherit from it and implement its abstract methods.

Example of a concrete implementation (conceptual):

```python
from interfaces.symbolic_interface import SymbolicInterface
from typing import Any, Dict, List

class MySymbolicProcessor(SymbolicInterface):
    def apply_symbolic_upgrade(self, forecast: Dict, upgrade_map: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Implementation for applying an upgrade
        print(f"Applying upgrade to forecast using map: {upgrade_map}")
        # ... actual logic ...
        forecast['symbolic_status'] = 'upgraded'
        return forecast

    def rewrite_forecast_symbolics(self, forecasts: List[Dict], upgrade_plan: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
        # Implementation for rewriting symbolics
        print(f"Rewriting symbolics for {len(forecasts)} forecasts using plan: {upgrade_plan}")
        # ... actual logic ...
        return [self.apply_symbolic_upgrade(f, upgrade_plan.get('default_map', {})) for f in forecasts]

    def generate_upgrade_trace(self, original: Dict, mutated: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Implementation for generating a trace
        print("Generating upgrade trace...")
        return {"original_hash": hash(str(original)), "mutated_hash": hash(str(mutated)), "changes": "details..."}

    def log_symbolic_mutation(self, trace: Dict, path: str = "logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl"):
        # Implementation for logging
        print(f"Logging mutation trace to {path}: {trace}")
        # import json # Ensure json is imported in a real implementation
        with open(path, 'a') as f:
            f.write(str(trace) + '\n') # Simplified, consider json.dumps(trace)

    def compute_alignment(self, symbolic_tag: str, variables: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        # Implementation for computing alignment
        print(f"Computing alignment for tag '{symbolic_tag}' with variables: {variables}")
        return 0.95 # Example alignment score

    def alignment_report(self, tag: str, variables: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implementation for generating an alignment report
        print(f"Generating alignment report for tag '{tag}'")
        return {"tag": tag, "score": self.compute_alignment(tag, variables), "details": "..."}

# Usage (hypothetical)
# processor = MySymbolicProcessor()
# upgraded_forecast = processor.apply_symbolic_upgrade({}, {})
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   The default file path in the [`log_symbolic_mutation()`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:18) method is hardcoded: `"logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl"`. While this provides a default, it might be better managed via a configuration setting in a production system.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   Implementations of this interface will be tightly coupled to the structure of `forecast` objects (`Dict`), `upgrade_map` (`Dict`), `upgrade_plan` (`Dict`), and `trace` objects (`Dict`). Changes to these data structures could necessitate changes in the concrete implementations.
*   The interface dictates specific method signatures, creating a contract that implementing classes must adhere to.

## 8. Existing Tests

Based on the file structure of the `tests/` directory, there does not appear to be a dedicated test file for [`interfaces/symbolic_interface.py`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:1) (e.g., `test_symbolic_interface.py`).
Since this module defines an interface (ABC), tests would typically target concrete implementations of this interface rather than the interface itself. However, it might be beneficial to have tests that ensure any concrete implementation correctly adheres to the contract (e.g., implements all abstract methods).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module defines a single abstract base class, [`SymbolicInterface`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:4). This class outlines a set of methods that must be implemented by any concrete class aiming to provide symbolic processing capabilities. The flow is that other parts of the system will interact with an instance of a *concrete implementation* of this interface, calling its methods to perform symbolic operations.

The defined methods are:
*   [`apply_symbolic_upgrade(self, forecast: Dict, upgrade_map: Dict) -> Dict`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:6)
*   [`rewrite_forecast_symbolics(self, forecasts: List[Dict], upgrade_plan: Dict) -> List[Dict]`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:10)
*   [`generate_upgrade_trace(self, original: Dict, mutated: Dict) -> Dict`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:14)
*   [`log_symbolic_mutation(self, trace: Dict, path: str = "logs/symbolic_mutation_log.jsonl")`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:18)
*   [`compute_alignment(self, symbolic_tag: str, variables: Dict[str, Any]) -> float`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:22)
*   [`alignment_report(self, tag: str, variables: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:26)

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** [`SymbolicInterface`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:4) uses PascalCase, which is standard for Python classes.
*   **Method Names:** All method names (e.g., [`apply_symbolic_upgrade`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:6), [`rewrite_forecast_symbolics`](interfaces/symbolic_interface.py:10)) use snake_case, which is the PEP 8 standard.
*   **Parameter Names:** Parameter names (e.g., `forecast`, `upgrade_map`, `symbolic_tag`) also use snake_case.
The naming conventions appear consistent and follow Python best practices (PEP 8). There are no obvious AI assumption errors or deviations.
