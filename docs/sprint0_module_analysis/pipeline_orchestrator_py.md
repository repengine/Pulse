# Module Analysis: `pipeline/orchestrator.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`pipeline/orchestrator.py`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:1) module is to schedule and execute the end-to-end AI training pipeline. This includes stages such as data preprocessing, model training/fine-tuning, model evaluation, and rule generation/pruning. It acts as the central coordinator for the various components involved in the training lifecycle.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be a functional, albeit relatively simple, implementation of an orchestrator.
- It defines a clear sequence of operations for a training cycle: preprocess, train, evaluate, and manage rules.
- It includes a basic daily scheduling mechanism using the `schedule` library.
- There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass`, `NotImplementedError`) or "TODO" comments within the provided code, suggesting the core implemented functionality is considered complete at this stage.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Error Handling and Resilience:** The current implementation lacks robust error handling. If any step in the [`run_training_cycle()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30) fails, the entire process might halt without a clear recovery mechanism or detailed logging of the failure.
*   **Configuration Management:** Key parameters like `raw_data_dir`, `feature_store_path`, and `model_registry_uri` are passed during instantiation. A more mature system might use a dedicated configuration file or environment variables for better flexibility and management, especially for deployment. The example usage hardcodes these.
*   **Advanced Scheduling:** The scheduling is basic (daily at a fixed time). More advanced needs (e.g., conditional runs, retries, dependency-based scheduling, backfilling) are not supported.
*   **State Management/Logging:** There's no explicit logging of the orchestrator's own state or progress beyond what the individual components ([`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13), [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14), etc.) might do. A central logging mechanism for the orchestration process itself would be beneficial for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Parameterization of Cycle Steps:** The steps within [`run_training_cycle()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30) are fixed. There's no mechanism to easily customize or parameterize these steps (e.g., skip a step, pass specific configurations to a step for a particular run).
*   **No Asynchronous Operations:** The training cycle runs synchronously. For long-running tasks, this could be inefficient. Asynchronous execution or a task queue system might be a logical next step for scalability.
*   **Rule Engine Integration Details:** The interaction with [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16) ([`generate_rules()`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:53), [`evaluate_rules()`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:54), [`prune_rules()`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:55)) is high-level. The specifics of how these rules are used or how they influence subsequent training cycles are not detailed in this module.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
*   [`pipeline.preprocessor.Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13)
*   [`pipeline.model_manager.ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14)
*   [`pipeline.evaluator.Evaluator`](pipeline/evaluator.py:15)
*   [`pipeline.rule_engine.RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16)

### External Library Dependencies:
*   `schedule` (for scheduling the training cycle)
*   `time` (for `time.sleep` in the scheduling loop)

### Interaction via Shared Data:
*   **Feature Store:** The [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13) saves features to a path ([`feature_store_path`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:22)), which is then used by the [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14) for training and the [`Evaluator`](pipeline/evaluator.py:15) for evaluation. The example shows this as [`"pipeline/features.parquet"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:70).
*   **Model Registry:** The [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14) interacts with a model registry (e.g., MLflow, specified by [`model_registry_uri`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:23)). It logs models and metrics there. The example uses [`"mlflow://localhost:5000"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:71).
*   **Raw Data:** The [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13) reads from a [`raw_data_dir`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:21). The example uses [`"data/"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:69).

### Input/Output Files:
*   **Input:** Raw data files from [`raw_data_dir`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:21).
*   **Output/Intermediate:**
    *   Processed features (e.g., [`features.parquet`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:70)) generated by [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13).
    *   Models and metrics logged to the model registry by [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14).
    *   Potentially, rules generated/managed by [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16) (though their storage isn't specified in this module).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### Class: `Orchestrator`

**Instantiation:**
```python
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    raw_data_dir="data/",
    feature_store_path="pipeline/features.parquet",
    model_registry_uri="mlflow://localhost:5000",
)
```
This creates an orchestrator instance, initializing the preprocessor, model manager, evaluator, and rule engine with their respective configurations.

**Running a Single Training Cycle:**
```python
orchestrator.run_training_cycle()
```
This method executes the defined sequence: data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and rule engine operations.

**Scheduling Daily Training Cycles:**
```python
orchestrator.schedule_daily(time_str="02:00")
```
This schedules the [`run_training_cycle()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30) method to be executed daily at "02:00". The method then enters an infinite loop to check for and run pending scheduled tasks.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Schedule Time:** In [`schedule_daily()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:57), the default time for the daily run is hardcoded as [`"02:00"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:57).
*   **Schedule Loop Sleep Interval:** In [`schedule_daily()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:57), the `time.sleep()` duration is hardcoded to [`30`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:64) seconds.
*   **Example Usage Paths/URIs:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block (lines [`66-73`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:66)) hardcodes:
    *   [`raw_data_dir="data/"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:69)
    *   [`feature_store_path="pipeline/features.parquet"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:70)
    *   [`model_registry_uri="mlflow://localhost:5000"`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:71)
    *   [`schedule_daily("02:00")`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:73)

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **High Coupling with Pipeline Components:** The [`Orchestrator`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:18) is tightly coupled to specific implementations of [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13), [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14), [`Evaluator`](pipeline/evaluator.py:15), and [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16). Changes to the interfaces of these components would directly require changes in the orchestrator.
*   **Sequential Execution Flow:** The [`run_training_cycle()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30) method defines a fixed, sequential flow of operations. This creates a dependency where each step relies on the successful completion of the previous one in that specific order.
*   **Data Exchange Format:** Relies on the [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13) outputting a feature path (string) that is consumable by [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14) and [`Evaluator`](pipeline/evaluator.py:15). The format of `model_info` returned by [`ModelManager.train()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:46) and consumed by [`Evaluator.evaluate()`](pipeline/evaluator.py:49) and [`ModelManager.log_metrics()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:50) is another coupling point.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   No specific test file (e.g., `test_orchestrator.py` or `test_pipeline_orchestrator.py`) was found in the [`tests/pipeline/`](tests/pipeline) directory or the main [`tests/`](tests/) directory.
*   This suggests a lack of dedicated unit or integration tests for the [`Orchestrator`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:18) module itself. The components it uses ([`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13), [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14), etc.) might have their own tests, but the orchestration logic and scheduling are likely untested.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module defines a single class, [`Orchestrator`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:18).
    *   The constructor initializes instances of the four main pipeline components: [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13), [`ModelManager`](pipeline/model_manager.py:14), [`Evaluator`](pipeline/evaluator.py:15), and [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16).
*   **Control Flow:**
    1.  An [`Orchestrator`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:18) instance is created with paths for data and model registry.
    2.  The [`run_training_cycle()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30) method is the core operational flow:
        *   Calls [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13) methods to load, merge, normalize, compute features, and save features.
        *   Calls [`ModelManager.train()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:46) with the feature path.
        *   Calls [`Evaluator.evaluate()`](pipeline/evaluator.py:49) with model info and feature path.
        *   Calls [`ModelManager.log_metrics()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:50).
        *   Calls [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16) methods to generate, evaluate, and prune rules.
    3.  The [`schedule_daily()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:57) method uses the `schedule` library to set up a daily recurring call to [`run_training_cycle()`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30) and then enters an infinite loop, periodically checking for and running pending tasks.
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Raw data directory path -> [`Preprocessor`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:13)
    *   Feature store path (string) <- [`Preprocessor.save_features()`](pipeline/preprocessor.py:43)
    *   Feature store path (string) -> [`ModelManager.train()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:46), [`Evaluator.evaluate()`](pipeline/evaluator.py:49)
    *   Model info (object/dict) <- [`ModelManager.train()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:46)
    *   Model info (object/dict) -> [`Evaluator.evaluate()`](pipeline/evaluator.py:49), [`ModelManager.log_metrics()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:50)
    *   Metrics (object/dict) <- [`Evaluator.evaluate()`](pipeline/evaluator.py:49)
    *   Metrics (object/dict) -> [`ModelManager.log_metrics()`](pipeline/model_manager.py:50)

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** [`Orchestrator`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:18) (PascalCase) - Follows PEP 8.
*   **Method Names:** [`__init__`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:19), [`run_training_cycle`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:30), [`schedule_daily`](pipeline/orchestrator.py:57) (snake_case) - Follows PEP 8.
*   **Variable Names:** `raw_data_dir`, `feature_store_path`, `model_registry_uri`, `preprocessor`, `model_manager`, `evaluator`, `rule_engine`, `feature_path`, `model_info`, `metrics`, `time_str` (snake_case) - Follows PEP 8.
*   **Type Hinting:** Used for method parameters and return types (e.g., `raw_data_dir: str`, `-> None`).
*   **Docstrings:** Present for the module, class, and public methods, explaining their purpose. The format is generally good.

Overall, naming conventions appear consistent and adhere to PEP 8. No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations were noted in the naming.
