# Module Analysis: `learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py) module is to provide a collection of basic feature engineering transformations. These transformations are intended for use on time series and text data, primarily structured within `pandas` DataFrames, to prepare data for machine learning models within the Pulse system.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operational for the implemented transformations. Most functions are well-defined and seem complete for their stated purpose.

However, the [`sentiment_score`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:61) function is explicitly a placeholder, as noted in its docstring: *"This is a placeholder for a more sophisticated NLP pipeline."* and comments: *"This is a very simplistic implementation. In a real system, you would use a proper NLP library."*

No "TODO" comments or obvious placeholders were found in other functions.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Sophisticated Sentiment Analysis:** The most significant gap is the [`sentiment_score`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:61) function, which requires replacement with a robust NLP pipeline.
*   **Extensibility:** While the current transforms are useful, the module could be expanded to include a wider array of common and advanced feature transformations (e.g., date/time features, more complex text vectorization, binning, scaling, encoding categorical features).
*   **Error Handling:** Some functions like [`rolling_window`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:9) and [`lag_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:34) use `bfill()` to handle NaNs introduced by transformations. While this is a valid strategy, more configurable NaN handling might be beneficial.
*   **Feature Selection Integration:** The module currently assumes features are pre-selected or transforms all numeric features by default. Integration with feature selection mechanisms could be a logical next step.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from other project modules:
*   None. This module is self-contained in terms of project-specific code.

### External Library Dependencies:
*   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (as `pd`): Used extensively for DataFrame and Series manipulation.
*   [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) (as `np`): Used implicitly by `pandas` and for numerical operations.
*   `typing` (`Optional`, `Union`, `List`): Used for type hinting.

### Interaction with other modules via shared data:
*   This module is designed to be called by other parts of the Pulse system, likely within the `learning` pipeline, to transform data before model training or inference.
*   It interacts by receiving `pandas.DataFrame` objects as input and returning `pandas.Series` objects (or `pandas.DataFrame` internally before averaging in some cases).

### Input/Output Files:
*   The module does not directly interact with files (logs, data files, metadata). It operates on in-memory `pandas` DataFrames.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

All functions in this module operate on `pandas.DataFrame` and return a `pandas.Series`.

*   **[`rolling_window(df: pd.DataFrame, window: int = 5, features: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> pd.Series`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:9):**
    *   **Purpose:** Applies a rolling window aggregation (mean) to specified numeric features of a DataFrame. If no features are specified, it uses all numeric columns.
    *   **Usage:** `transformed_series = rolling_window(my_dataframe, window=10, features=['value_col1', 'value_col2'])`

*   **[`lag_features(df: pd.DataFrame, lags: List[int] = [1, 3, 7], features: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> pd.Series`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:34):**
    *   **Purpose:** Creates lagged versions of specified features for time series forecasting. If no features are specified, it uses all numeric columns. The output is the mean of all generated lagged features.
    *   **Usage:** `lagged_series = lag_features(my_dataframe, lags=[1, 2, 3], features=['temperature'])`

*   **[`sentiment_score(df: pd.DataFrame, text_col: str = 'text') -> pd.Series`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:61):**
    *   **Purpose:** (Placeholder) Calculates a very simple sentiment score (-1 to 1) for a given text column based on predefined positive/negative word lists.
    *   **Usage:** `sentiment = sentiment_score(my_dataframe, text_col='article_content')`
    *   **Note:** This is a simplistic placeholder and should be replaced by a proper NLP solution.

*   **[`interaction_features(df: pd.DataFrame, features: List[str]) -> pd.Series`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:103):**
    *   **Purpose:** Creates interaction features by calculating the product of the specified feature columns.
    *   **Usage:** `interaction = interaction_features(my_dataframe, features=['feature_a', 'feature_b'])`

*   **[`polynomial_features(df: pd.DataFrame, feature: str, degree: int = 2) -> pd.Series`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:124):**
    *   **Purpose:** Creates polynomial features for a single specified column up to a given degree.
    *   **Usage:** `poly_feat = polynomial_features(my_dataframe, feature='my_numeric_col', degree=3)`

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **[`rolling_window`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:9):**
    *   Default `window` size is hardcoded to `5`.
*   **[`lag_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:34):**
    *   Default `lags` list is hardcoded to `[1, 3, 7]`.
*   **[`sentiment_score`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:61):**
    *   Default `text_col` is hardcoded to `'text'`.
    *   `positive_words` ([`line 77`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:77)) and `negative_words` ([`line 78`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:78)) lists are hardcoded. This is part of its placeholder status.
    *   Returns `0` if `text_col` is not found or if text is not a string, which is a hardcoded default behavior.
*   **[`polynomial_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:124):**
    *   Default `degree` is hardcoded to `2`.

While default values are common, the hardcoded word lists in `sentiment_score` are a clear sign of its placeholder status.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Strong Coupling to `pandas`:** The module is tightly coupled to the `pandas` library, relying on its DataFrame and Series structures for all inputs and outputs.
*   **Data Structure Dependency:** Assumes input data is in a `pandas.DataFrame`.
*   **Implicit NLP Dependency (Future):** The [`sentiment_score`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:61) function, once properly implemented, will introduce a dependency on an NLP library (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, Transformers).
*   **Consumer Modules:** This module is intended to be used by other modules that perform feature engineering or data preprocessing, creating a dependency from those consumers to this module.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   No dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/learning/transforms/test_basic_transforms.py`) was found during the analysis.
*   This indicates a gap in test coverage for this module. Each transformation function should ideally have unit tests covering various scenarios, including edge cases and NaN handling.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   The module consists of a set of independent utility functions.
*   Each function takes a `pandas.DataFrame` and specific parameters as input.
*   It performs a specific transformation on one or more columns of the DataFrame.
*   It returns a `pandas.Series` containing the transformed feature(s). In some cases (e.g., [`rolling_window`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:9), [`lag_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:34) with multiple input features), an intermediate DataFrame might be created, but the final output is a Series representing an aggregation or a single transformed feature.
*   There is no internal state maintained within the module between function calls.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** Names like [`rolling_window`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:9), [`lag_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:34), [`sentiment_score`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:61), [`interaction_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:103), and [`polynomial_features`](../../learning/transforms/basic_transforms.py:124) are descriptive and follow Python's `snake_case` convention (PEP 8).
*   **Variables:** Variable names (`df`, `window`, `features`, `lags`, `text_col`, `scores`, `result`, `base`) are generally clear and concise.
*   **Parameters:** Parameter names are descriptive.
*   **Consistency:** Naming is consistent throughout the module.
*   No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations from PEP 8 were noted.
