# Historical Retrodiction System Plan for Pulse

## 1. Module Analysis
- Analyze existing retrodiction submodels (e.g., `simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py`, `trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py`, etc.).
- Review related tests (e.g., `tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py`) to understand current functionality.

## 2. Timeline File Replacement
- Replace the current JSON timeline file (`retrodiction_latest.json`) with a new file (`historical_timeline.json`) that fully verifies historical events.
- Define the timeline with explicit era definitions, including fields such as start/end dates, impact factors, and configuration parameters.

## 3. Retrodiction Engine Refinement
- Update existing modules to load and process the new timeline file.
- Incorporate logic for differentiating eras so that each era's characteristics affect the retrodiction process dynamically.

## 4. Validation and Testing
- Optionally define a JSON schema for the new timeline file.
- Update or add tests to ensure proper timeline loading, era differentiation, and retrodiction output.

## 5. Integration with Pulse
- Leverage existing retrodiction submodels to ensure consistency.
- Update documentation and internal guides to reflect the improvements in the retrodiction process.

This plan outlines the steps required to bootstrap the historical retrodiction system in Pulse, ensuring that the system can handle different eras with fully verifiable timelines and dynamic processing adjustments.
