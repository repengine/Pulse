# Module Analysis: `engine/gravity_correction.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The module [`engine/gravity_correction.py`](engine/gravity_correction.py) (formerly `symbolic_system/gravity/engines/residual_gravity_engine.py`) is responsible for providing a de-symbolized gravity correction mechanism. Its primary function is to learn and apply corrections to the simulation's trajectory, nudging it closer to observed reality or a target baseline by analyzing quantitative residuals. This module operates independently of the legacy symbolic system.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

This module was moved and refactored as part of Pulse v0.10 to remove dependencies on the symbolic system. Its core logic for calculating and applying gravity-like corrections based on numeric residuals is intended to be preserved and enhanced. It respects the `gravity_correction_enabled` configuration flag.

## 3. Key Functionalities (Post-Refactor)

*   Calculates deviations (residuals) between simulation outputs and target values.
*   Learns corrective adjustments based on these residuals.
*   Applies these adjustments to the `WorldStateV2` if enabled via configuration.
*   Operates purely on quantitative data.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies (Post-Refactor)

*   **`core.worldstate_v2`**: Reads from and applies corrections to `WorldStateV2` objects.
*   **Configuration System (Pydantic/YAML)**: Reads the `gravity_correction_enabled` flag and other relevant parameters.
*   Potentially interacts with other `engine/` components for data or triggers.

*(Further details to be added as development and refactoring progress for v0.10.)*
