## Sprint Summary

Sprint 13 successfully addressed all three remaining test failures, resulting in a fully green test suite (excluding warnings).

*   **Tasks Completed:** 3
    *   **GTB13-001:** Fixed `test_predict_default` in `TestAIForecaster` ([`tests/test_ai_forecaster.py`](tests/test_ai_forecaster.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_predict_default` failure (AssertionError: non-zero adjustment != 0.0) was resolved. The fix involved patching the module-level `_model` and `_input_size` variables in `forecast_engine.ai_forecaster` within the test `test_predict_default` in [`tests/test_ai_forecaster.py`](tests/test_ai_forecaster.py) to ensure a predictable, controlled environment for the `predict` function call, leading to the expected `0.0` adjustment.
    *   **GTB13-002:** Fixed `test_adjust_rules_from_learning` in `TestRuleAdjustment` ([`tests/test_rule_adjustment.py`](tests/test_rule_adjustment.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_adjust_rules_from_learning` failure (`AssertionError: register_variable(...) call not found`) was resolved. The fix involved two parts:
            1.  Modifying assertions for `mock_register_variable` in [`tests/test_rule_adjustment.py`](tests/test_rule_adjustment.py) to use `self.assertAlmostEqual` for the 'default' floating-point values.
            2.  Correcting the patch target for `log_variable_weight_change` from `'core.pulse_learning_log.log_variable_weight_change'` to `'trust_system.rule_adjustment.log_variable_weight_change'` to resolve a `mock_log.call_count` assertion error.
    *   **GTB13-003:** Fixed `test_compute_risk_score_no_memory` in `TestRiskScoring` ([`tests/test_trust_engine_risk.py`](tests/test_trust_engine_risk.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_compute_risk_score_no_memory` failure (`AssertionError: 0.26 != 0.06`) was resolved. The `compute_risk_score` function in [`trust_system/trust_engine.py`](trust_system/trust_engine.py) was modified to correctly set the `historical_component_value` (used in the weighted sum) to `0.0` when no historical forecasts are available. This aligns with the test's expectation for the 'no memory' scenario and ensures the risk score is calculated correctly under these conditions.

*   **Test Suite Status (End of Sprint 13):**
    *   Passed: 458
    *   Failed: 0
    *   Warnings: 40
    *   (Previous baseline at start of Sprint 13: 3 Failed, 455 Passed)

## Key Outcomes & Learnings

*   Successfully resolved all 3 targeted test failures.
*   **The test suite is now 100% green (0 failures)!**
*   Key fixes involved correcting mock targets for module-level variables, using appropriate float comparison techniques (`self.assertAlmostEqual`), and ensuring correct default values in edge-case logic.

---

## Remaining Warnings (40)

(Based on `pytest -q` output from 2025-05-12, after GTB13-003 fix)
*   Numerous `PydanticDeprecatedSince20` warnings.
*   Numerous `PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` warnings.
*   Numerous `DeprecationWarning` related to `datetime.utcnow()`.
*   One `DeprecationWarning` for `foresight_architecture.digest_exporter`.

---

**Next Steps:**
*   Consider a dedicated sprint to address the 40 outstanding warnings to improve code health and future-proof the application.
*   Proceed with any further development or refactoring tasks now that the build is green.
