# AI-Driven Rule Adaptation Plan

## 1. Codebase Analysis
- Inventory existing rule definitions and tunable parameters (simulation_engine/rules, rule_engine.py).
- Identify how the simulator reports performance (metrics like fragility, confidence, drift).

## 2. Rule Parameter Extraction
- Refactor each rule into a parameterized form (e.g. weight, threshold, decay_rate).
- Generate a schema or registry of rule parameters with valid ranges.

## 3. Define Evaluation Metrics & Reward
- Select one or more robustness metrics (e.g. average fragility over N forks, confidence variance).
- Compose a scalar reward: high reward = stable, confident forecasts with low drift.

## 4. Build an RL Environment Wrapper
- Wrap the simulation loop in an OpenAI-Gym style "step" interface:
  - State = snapshot of worldstate features + current rule parameters
  - Action = adjustment to one or more rule parameters
  - Reward = computed robustness metric after one simulation episode
  - Episode termination = fixed number of turns or forks

## 5. AI Algorithm Integration
### Option A: Reinforcement Learning
- Choose an off-the-shelf agent (DQN, PPO) via Stable-Baselines3 or RLlib.
- Train agent to maximize robustness reward.
### Option B: Bayesian Optimization
- Use Optuna or scikit-optimize to tune rule parameters.
- Define an objective function that runs the simulator and returns reward.

## 6. Experiment Management & Tracking
- Integrate MLflow to log hyperparameters and rewards.
- Automate experiment sweeps and compare performance across runs.

## 7. Validation & Deployment
- Select top-performing rule configurations.
- Run extended stress tests / adversarial scenarios to confirm robustness.
- Commit tuned rules back into simulation_config.yaml or a new "AI-tuned" preset.
- Add CI checks that re-train/tune periodically or on config changes.
