# Sprint 7 Outcome

**Sprint Number:** 7

**Sprint Goal:** Address critical blockers in visualization, advanced feature processing, and S3 data storage to improve test pass rates and overall system stability.

## Work Items:

*   **GTB7-001 (Visualization tests):**
    *   **Status:** Done
    *   **Summary of resolution:** The `AttributeError` in `plot_metrics_dashboard` tests was resolved by ensuring the source code in `recursive_training/advanced_metrics/visualization.py` uses NumPy-style tuple indexing (e.g., `axs[0, 0]`) and the test mock in `tests/recursive_training/advanced_metrics/test_visualization.py` correctly provides a NumPy array where each element is a fully configured `MagicMock`. All targeted tests (`test_plot_metrics_dashboard`, `test_plot_metrics_dashboard_no_show`, `test_plot_reliability_diagram`) now pass.

*   **GTB7-002 (AdvancedFeatureProcessor tests):**
    *   **Status:** Blocked
    *   **Reason:** TensorFlow/Windows compatibility. Tests `TestAdvancedFeatureProcessor::test_process` and `TestAdvancedFeatureProcessor::test_process_with_disabled_techniques` are failing because `apply_time_frequency_decomposition` is not called. The root cause appears to be an underlying issue with TensorFlow/Keras operations within `apply_self_supervised_learning` due to TensorFlow no longer supporting native Windows.

*   **GTB7-003 (S3DataStore tests):**
    *   **Status:** Done
    *   **Summary of resolution:** The `AssertionError: assert 'source' in {}` for `TestS3DataStore::test_retrieve_dataset_s3_direct_read` and `TestS3DataStore::test_retrieve_dataset_s3_with_cache` was resolved by modifying the `retrieve_dataset_s3` method in `recursive_training/data/s3_data_store.py` to correctly include the 'source' key in the returned metadata dictionary. Both tests now pass.

## Final Test Suite Status:

*   19 failed
*   439 passed
*   40 warnings

## LOC Delta:

*   Not tracked this sprint

## MCP Usage:

*   Not tracked this sprint

## Notes/Observations:

*   The TensorFlow on Windows compatibility issue is a significant blocker for GTB7-002 (AdvancedFeatureProcessor tests) and needs to be addressed to move forward with those tests.
