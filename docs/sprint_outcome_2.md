# Sprint Outcome: Green the Build (Sprint 2)

**Sprint Goal:** Continue resolving critical errors and warnings, focusing on fixture issues and common error patterns, to move closer to a stable build.

## Completed Work Items:
*   GTB2-001: Resolve Missing or Misconfigured Pytest Fixtures (Partially addressed by user for `tests/recursive_training/rules/`; broader review pending)
*   GTB2-002: Address `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'enable_dict_compatibility'`
*   GTB2-004: Resolve `ImportError`s preventing tests in `tests/test_simulator_core.py` from running
*   GTB2-003: Investigate and Remediate Common `TypeError`s and General `AttributeError`s (Addressed `StopIteration` and mock side effect patterns)

## Final Test Status (`pytest -q` at end of sprint):
*   Passed: 405
*   Failed: 50
*   Errors: 12
*   Warnings: 31

## DoD Lite Check:
*   (a) All imports succeed: Likely OK
*   (b) All tests pass: **Failed**
*   (c) CI linting score >= 9.0: Not Verified (31 warnings remain)
*   (d) MCP smoke works: Not Verified

## Sprint Outcome:
Partially Successful. Key blockers like critical `ImportError`s and some common `TypeError` patterns were resolved, leading to an increase in passing tests (from 385 to 405) and a decrease in failures (from 70 to 50). However, the build is not yet green due to remaining test failures, errors, and warnings. The sprint goal was not fully met.
