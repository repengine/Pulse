# Sprint Outcome: Sprint 5 - Build Stability Improved

## Sprint Goal
Continue resolving critical errors and warnings, focusing on `recursive_training` submodules, gravity explainer tests, and visualization errors, to significantly improve build stability.

## Sprint Summary
Sprint 5 successfully addressed all planned work items, leading to a reduction in critical test failures and errors.

### Completed Work Items:
-   **GTB5-001:** Resolved failures in the `recursive_training/error_handling` submodule. All associated tests are now passing.
-   **GTB5-004:** Resolved mock failures in `tests/recursive_training/test_feature_processor_integration.py`. All associated tests are now passing.
-   **GTB5-002:** Addressed failures in `tests/test_gravity_explainer.py`. The `test_simulation_trace_contains_gravity_details` test now passes.
-   **GTB5-003:** Fixed errors in the visualization module, specifically resolving a `ValueError` in `test_plot_metrics_dashboard` and an `AssertionError` in `test_plot_reliability_diagram`.

### Test Suite Status at End of Sprint:
-   **Passed:** 431
-   **Failed:** 27
-   **Warnings:** 39

## Learnings & Next Steps
While significant progress was made in resolving specific test failures, the overall number of failed tests (27) indicates that further sprints are necessary to achieve a fully green build. The focus should continue on systematically addressing the remaining failures.
