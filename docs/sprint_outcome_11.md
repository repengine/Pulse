# Sprint 11 Outcome

**Sprint Goal:** Address failing tests in `S3DataStore` and `StreamingDataStore` within the `recursive_training` module to continue improving test coverage and system stability.

**Start Date:** 2025-05-12
**End Date:** 2025-05-12

## Sprint Summary

Sprint 11 successfully addressed all three planned test failures in the `recursive_training.data` module, resolving a total of four individual test failures.

*   **Tasks Completed:** 3
    *   **GTB11-001:** Fixed `test_store_dataset_s3` in `TestS3DataStore` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_store_dataset_s3` failures (AssertionError for `dataset_id` and a logged `WinError 3`) were resolved. The test was updated to control `dataset_id` generation by patching `datetime.now` within the `recursive_training.data.data_store` module for predictable IDs. The mock for `_get_optimized_storage_path` was corrected to target `'recursive_training.data.s3_data_store.S3DataStore._get_optimized_storage_path'`, ensuring a valid string path was used and resolving the `WinError`.
    *   **GTB11-002:** Fixed `test_fallback_to_parent_methods` in `TestS3DataStore` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_s3_data_store.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_fallback_to_parent_methods` failure (mock for `retrieve_dataset_optimized` not called) was resolved. The `unittest.mock.patch` target was corrected to `'recursive_training.data.optimized_data_store.OptimizedDataStore.retrieve_dataset_optimized'`, ensuring the mock was applied to the method on the parent class as called via `super()`.
    *   **GTB11-003:** Fixed `test_streaming_with_filtering` and `test_streaming_with_pyarrow` in `TestStreamingDataStore` ([`tests/recursive_training/test_streaming_data_store.py`](tests/recursive_training/test_streaming_data_store.py)).
        *   **Details:** The `test_streaming_with_filtering` (`AssertionError: 0 != 16`) and `test_streaming_with_pyarrow` (`AssertionError: 0 != 5`) failures were resolved. The root cause was that `StreamingDataStore.store_dataset` was not creating the Parquet files. This was fixed by overriding `store_dataset` in [`StreamingDataStore`](recursive_training/data/streaming_data_store.py) to delegate to `self.store_dataset_optimized`, ensuring Parquet files are written by the parent class logic, making data available for streaming tests.

*   **Test Suite Status (End of Sprint 11):**
    *   Passed: 452
    *   Failed: 6
    *   Warnings: 40
    *   (Previous baseline at start of Sprint 11: 8 Failed, 450 Passed)

## Key Outcomes & Learnings

*   Successfully resolved 4 test failures across 3 tasks in the `recursive_training.data` module.
*   The number of failing tests in the suite decreased from 8 to 6.
*   Key fixes involved correct mocking of datetime for predictable ID generation, proper targeting of mocks for methods called via `super()`, and ensuring data persistence methods (`store_dataset` in `StreamingDataStore`) correctly create underlying data files for subsequent operations like streaming.

## Remaining Failing Tests (6)

(Based on `pytest -q` output from 2025-05-12, after GTB11-003 fix)

1.  `tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py::TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics::test_calculate_f1_score`
2.  `tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py::TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics::test_evaluate_rule_performance`
3.  `tests/recursive_training/test_training_metrics.py::TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics::test_get_performance_summary`
4.  `tests/test_ai_forecaster.py::TestAIForecaster::test_predict_default`
5.  `tests/test_rule_adjustment.py::TestRuleAdjustment::test_adjust_rules_from_learning`
6.  `tests/test_trust_engine_risk.py::TestRiskScoring::test_compute_risk_score_no_memory`

**Next Steps:**
*   Plan Sprint 12, focusing on the next set of high-priority failing tests, likely starting with the `TestRecursiveTrainingMetrics` issues.
*   Review the 40 warnings if time permits during Sprint 12.
