# Sprint Outcome: Green the Build (Sprint 4)

**Sprint Goal:** Continue resolving critical errors and warnings, focusing on AttributeErrors and data integrity issues in `recursive_training`, and mock verification failures, to significantly improve build stability.

## Completed Work Items:
*   GTB4-001: Resolve AttributeErrors in `recursive_training.advanced_metrics`
*   GTB4-002: Address Data Integrity and Processing Failures in `recursive_training`
*   GTB4-003: Fix Mock Call Verification Failures in `test_rule_generator.py`

## Final Test Status (`pytest -q` at end of sprint):
*   Passed: 420
*   Failed: 33
*   Errors: Not explicitly re-counted, was 4
*   Warnings: 39

## DoD Lite Check:
*   (a) All imports succeed: Likely OK
*   (b) All tests pass: **Failed**
*   (c) CI linting score >= 9.0: Not Verified (39 warnings remain)
*   (d) MCP smoke works: Not Verified

## Sprint Outcome:
Partially Successful. Key `AttributeError`s, data integrity issues, and mock verification failures in the `recursive_training` module were addressed. This led to an increase in passing tests (from 415 to 420) and a decrease in failures (from 38 to 33). Errors likely remained low. However, the build is not yet green due to remaining test failures and warnings. The sprint goal was not fully met.
