# AI Forecasting Integration Guide

This document details the integration of advanced AI predictive models into the Pulse Engine forecasting system, along with configuration, ensemble forecasting, and UI updates.

## Overview

The Pulse Engine now includes advanced AI forecasting capabilities integrated with traditional simulation forecasts. This enhancement aims to improve forecast accuracy and adapt to market conditions through continuous learning and ensemble methods.

## Integrated Modules

- **AI Forecaster (`forecast_engine/ai_forecaster.py`):**
  - `train(data: List[Dict]) -> None`: Trains the AI model using historical forecast data.
  - `predict(input_features: Dict) -> Dict`: Generates forecast adjustments based on input features.
  - `update(new_data: List[Dict]) -> None`: Allows for periodic model updates for continuous learning.

- **Forecast Ensemble (`forecast_engine/forecast_ensemble.py`):**
  - Combines the simulation-based forecast with AI adjustments using configurable weights defined in `core/pulse_config.py`.

- **Configuration Settings (`core/pulse_config.py`):**
  - Contains settings for enabling/disabling AI forecasting, training parameters, and ensemble weights.

- **Forecast Generation (`forecast_output/forecast_generator.py`):**
  - Integrates simulation and AI forecasts to produce a final ensemble forecast.

- **UI Visualization (`pulse_ui_operator.py`):**
  - Provides functions to display simulation, AI, and ensemble forecasts along with performance metrics.

## Testing

Unit tests for the AI forecasting components have been implemented in `tests/test_ai_forecaster.py`. These tests:
- Verify the default prediction behavior.
- Ensure the ensemble forecast calculates the expected combined value.
- Confirm that the `train` and `update` functions execute without errors.

## Usage and Future Directions

To generate forecasts using the integrated approach, call the forecast generation function in `forecast_output/forecast_generator.py`. The system will check the configuration and apply AI adjustments if enabled.

Future improvements may include:
- Enhanced AI model training with pre-trained networks.
- Real-time performance monitoring and dynamic ensemble weight adjustment.
- Extended UI visualizations to track model performance over time.
